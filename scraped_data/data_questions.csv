1,2,What autograding software do folks use for Java code?,"Grading currently either takes me a huge amount of time, or gets done in an extremely cursory way.  It occurs to me that, if my students were able to submit code into some sort of autotester, they would find many of their errors before I review their code.  This would mean that I would only have to look for clarity issues, not logic bugs.I am interested in software that (a) isn't too hard to set up, (b) will allow my students to test whether their code is (at least) to spec, and (c) allows me to quickly cycle through the code from all of the students in a section to look for style issues.I have looked far and wide, and have not yet found a reasonable system that accomplishes these three goals.  Many universities seem to have robust systems, but they all appear to be home-grown, and unavailable to outsiders.  Is anyone aware of such a system?  I honestly don't even care if it costs money - I just need a solution that makes this task more reasonable.",2017-05-23 14:20:02,27,True,"4,307",25,7,8,"['java', 'grading', 'auto-graders']",9,False
2,3,Is it possible to ensure division of labor on a group assignment?,"Let's say I've assigned my Intro to CS class their first group programming assignment. A common problem is that the most invested student in the group will end up doing the majority of the work. At grading time, there are techniques that can be used to determine how much work each individual did--I don't want to focus on that. Instead, I would like to hear if there are any ways to ensure that the group actually divides up tasks proportionately without planning their project for them.Is this possible? If so, how? More importantly, is it possible to do this without external pressure? How can we give them the incentive and tools to really want to cooperate? Assume that the class has been introduced to OOP and has completed a few assignments, but exposure to CS is minimal.Bonus: Is it actually better for the students' education to ensure this or to leave them to their own devices?",2017-05-23 14:20:35,7,True,471,10,0,4,['group-work'],1,False
3,4,Objects Lab Before Inheritance and Polymorphism,"I am finding it very difficult to create a lab for Objects in Java before we've involved Inheritance and Polymorphism.  The problem, as I see it, is that Inheritance and Polymorphism are basically the motivators for Objects in the first place.  As a result, the labs that I've created have all felt stodgy and artificial. However, as an instructional reality, waiting until we have all three ideas in place in a high school environment simply means biting off too much material.   Are there other ways to think about creating labs for Objects that would support the early understandings required while still being meaningful?",2017-05-23 14:21:14,27,True,631,9,1,11,"['object-oriented-paradigm', 'labs', 'ap-computer-science-a']",3,False
4,6,Teaching Induction to Prove the Correctness of Algorithms,"This is a subject that I have had a lot of trouble clarifying for students.  I can explain the components well enough, but I have trouble getting kids to connect the big picture of the proof to the smaller parts. Finding a good loop invariant almost seems more art than science, and while I can find them myself, I am at a loss with how to break that step down into coherent procedural steps.So, the question is this: how do you go about teaching Induction so that it is both intuitive and masterable?",2017-05-23 14:24:14,27,True,362,8,0,3,"['lesson-ideas', 'cs-theory', 'induction']",1,False
5,7,Should the first Programming/Algorithms class be taught in pseudo-code?,"When I was studying, my professors had different approaches when teaching programming to beginners:Choose a language with which the professor is comfortable and fulfills the course requirements but might not be so popular in the real world. I had this experience with Mathematica programming. We would spend lots of time dealing with this language and as a result less time dealing with the programming language per se.Teach in a flavor of pseudo-code. This makes it ""harder"" to commit errors cause by compilers, interpreters and syntax in general and allows the students to focus in the problem. Naturally has the disadvantage that you can't run your code anywhere.What do most professionals and students prefer when teaching/learning algorithms and basic programming?",2017-05-23 14:25:23,28,True,"1,270",22,1,9,['pseudo-code'],7,False
6,14,Cheating on labs,"It is spectacularly easy to cheat on CS labs at the high school level and above (roughly ages 14 and up), particularly on short, early assignments.  In fact, there is article in today's NY Times about this problem.For instance, for a very early assignment, a question might be:Create a small program that will ask the user for a word and a number n, and responds by printing out the word n times.This is a rather extreme example, but it could easily be the first part of a lab assignment for a student who has just encountered for loops for the first time.Detecting cheating here is nonsensical because a huge portion of the resulting code will be nearly identical even if the students didn't cheat. For that reason, I am seeking ways to discourage students from trying to cheat in the first place.What are some best practices for staving off the flow of plagiarism?",2017-05-23 14:51:40,27,True,"3,885",20,3,11,"['best-practice', 'labs', 'ethics', 'cheating']",9,False

There are some nice artistic representations And the idea of repeatedly cutting a phone book or dictionary in half until you find a number/word (basically binary search). The only problem is students don't use phone books/paper dictionaries anymore and the artistic representation doesn't imply an end goal/state.",2017-05-23 15:00:50,48,True,"6,549",40,5,29,"['recursion', 'teaching-analogy']",18,False
8,19,Using Processing as an entry point in an Introductory Course,"We have two entry points for programming students here: one is web-oriented and features HTML5/CSS3/ECMA6, and the other is in a robotics environment using LabView.

10,30,How can I convey the idea of a programming language vs. a markup language?,"When I try and teach web development to absolute beginners, I seem to always get a question about the roles of HTML/CSS/JS and about how the browser renders the HTML. It seems to me that the confusion lies in an explanation of what a markup language is as compared to a regular language (e.g. python, C, java, ruby). What is the best way to give an overview of what HTML is while being sure that my students understand HTML as a markup language?Would it be useful to include some of the history of HTML?

Would it be better to teach the front-end (HTML/CSS/JS) first or the back-end (Rails/SQL)?My instincts would suggest front end because the students can type something and immediately see results which can be much more engaging, but teaching JS as the first ""real"" programming language also bothers me because of the many confusing and missing language features.",2017-05-23 15:32:39,58,True,433,6,0,10,"['curriculum-design', 'web-development', 'front-end', 'back-end']",1,False
12,44,Recommended IDE for teaching web development to beginners,"I have been assisting an IT teacher who has recently started teaching computer science to year 7-9s (11-13 year-olds). This year they will just be covering basic client-side web development: HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.I was shocked to see him, and the kids, writing their HTML in Notepad- it makes code a lot harder to read, and simple typos, such as a missing bracket, almost impossible to spot. Which isn't ideal, especially for beginners. For my own coding, I always use InteliJ or WebStorm, however, I would worry that this might go in the opposite direction, and actually over-complicate things.Anyone got any suggestions of a simple free IDE or text editor for web development for school kids? (It would need to be possible to install on school network).I'm thinking maybe something simple like Notepad++, Sublime, or possibly Atom. But would love to here your feedback or suggestions on what might be good for school kids.Thanks very much,

13,46,What are effective approaches for teaching dynamic programming?,"Dynamic programming is a subject that's notoriously difficult to learn and to teach. It's one thing to educate oneself, say by reading the appropriate chapters in Kleinberg & Tardos or CLRS, and working through a sufficient number of example problems. It's another matter to learn or teach this material in a classroom setting at the high school, undergraduate, or graduate level. Intrinsic to the subject is the skill of identifying the type of problem structure that's amenable to the dynamic programming approach.In light of this, what are effective approaches for teaching dynamic programming?",2017-05-23 16:02:52,62,True,764,16,2,3,"['lesson-ideas', 'algorithms']",0,False
14,59,Using microcontrollers in an Introductory course,"Are there any advantages to using small microcontrollers (such as an Arduino, etc.) with tactile, physical I/O (such as buttons, LEDs, robotic actuators, etc.)?

17,66,How does one create a balanced AI curriculum in light of the popularity of Deep Learning?,"During the past decade, interest in machine learning has exploded, especially due to the many and growing successes of deep learning approaches using convolutional and other neural networks.To those familiar with a modern artificial intelligence curriculum, say embodied by Russel & Norvig, ML may be safely regarded as a proper subset of AI. Yet due to the increasing popular attention to ML, more and more we bear witness to the conflation of AI and ML; even some computer scientists use AI and ML interchangeably.As CS educators who teach AI courses, how do you develop a balanced curriculum that incorporates ML, yet pays attention to crucial problems like commonsense reasoning and inference, which don't share the spotlight with ML and have so far, in fact, proven resistant to ML approaches, including deep learning?

19,76,Do automatic style hints help students to understand the language they're learning?,"Do automatic style hints (like those provided by linters) significantly increase the student's understanding of the language they're learning? I am asking because I assist in a course that uses a language that is not widely used. A linter does not exist yet, and I'm wondering whether it would be worth the effort to make one.Also, does it matter whether the style hints are provided as you type rather than upon saving or compiling the program?I would love to see quantified studies about this, but personal experience is very welcome too.Some things I am thinking about for a functional language (examples use Haskell) are listed below, but these are not vital for answering this question. Experience with other paradigms is appreciated as well!When parentheses are(n't) needed. A common faux pas is to surround every application of a constructor with parentheses ((Just 5)), even when they are not needed, because it is necessary in pattern matches.Writing int instead of Int, making a type variable instead of a concrete type.Using where clauses for helper functions.Suggesting pattern matches where guards where used (i.e., not checking | x == 5 but using a pattern match where x is replaced by 5.Recursion that may not terminate. For instance, students tend to get confused writing functions that get no parameters, and end up writing things like instance minBound ... where minBound = minBound.

20,79,How to raise students' security awareness in programming?,"My first website with a login form had the password hardcoded in the JavaScript code, and if the entered password matched it would redirect to a private URL that was just not linked anywhere, but still public if anyone knew the URL, and yes, that URL was also hardcoded in the JavaScript code.So in terms of security this was basically a ""Do not read"" banner, with the ""private"" content just written below it.Now, this is just a specific example of me not knowing any better in the early days of web development. There are many other domains in programming where you might introduce vulnerabilities if you don't think about what you're doing.Is there a generic technique to teach students to keep an eye on their code's security, maybe trying to get them into figuratively hacking their own programs and exploit vulnerabilities?",2017-05-23 18:42:46,69,True,397,15,0,6,"['web-development', 'security']",2,False

However, I'm unsure whether to include more difficult problems, like:Also, should I just allow the blank symbol and one other symbol or should I allow any number of symbols? Or maybe a mix. The difficulty will largely depend on this.Students learn thinking abstractly about these problems.

23,89,Should I have written tests on basic programming skills?,"When making more complex programs, it is natural that one needs to run the program to see whether things work and fixing bugs. However, if one makes a lot of mistakes in basic programming, e.g. writing = instead of ==, this will slow down coding a lot, so it needs to be avoided as much as possible. A possible solution to make students learn the basic syntax very well is to have a written test where students need to make small programs that only use basic syntax. Therefore, students need to learn to do these things right the first time, and also know the basic syntax very well.Will this be effective?

26,106,Scheme vs Haskell for introducing functional programming,"So, I am not interested in which language is better, because that is a matter of opinion.  What I care about is whether making a switch from Scheme to Haskell will directly help me accomplish my goals.  What programming language concepts does each language bring to the fore?So, I am seeking input from folks who have taught using these languages about the kinds of experiences they had.  How did the language features of Haskell or Scheme make your students' experience better (or worse)?For context, my kids come into their junior year knowing Java, C, and Python pretty well.  For their junior year, it was decided that there should be a course in theoretical computer science.  In order to have labs, I further decided that we should move away from imperative programming and expose the kids to a functional language.  So, while the class was not about functional programming, the kids did quite a lot of it.I used Scheme (DrRacket, to be specific), but over the course of the year, I found that kids were sneaking set functions into their labs, which ran (to my thinking) counter to the goals of the class.  I was also a little displeased with the rather unintuitive way that boolean functions and contracts interacted in the language.I have, as a result, been thinking about migrating over to Haskell.  If I did this, I know that I would need to redesign my labs (and I wonder if the Turing Machines I have them design would suddenly run very slowly!) But, other than not having a set function, what other benefits might Haskell bring to my students?

In order to ensure that the assignments I design are challenging, interesting, distinct, and of similar difficulty, what qualities should I try to emphasize? Keep in mind that these students should have a full knowledge of HTML+CSS, so anything can be included.Both specific ideas for layouts and CSS/HTML skills to try to include are valuable.

39,153,Command-line Java in AP CS A,"Context: Over the past school year I spent a significant portion of my time preparing to teach AP CS A next year. From choosing textbooks to writing the College Board syllabus, I essentially started from scratch in designing my course. I'm pleased with all aspects of it as it currently stands, but there is one nagging element: the programming environment.All students taking AP CS A next year have experience using Cloud9 because that's what we used for C/Python/HTML/CSS this year in AP CSP. Only in the last couple weeks did I discover how easy it is to install the JDK in a Cloud9 workspace and write, compile, and execute programs in Java from the command line. (I had read somewhere a while ago that Java and Cloud9 didn't play nicely.) I had been BlueJ all the way until that point, and I do still very much like BlueJ. However, not having taught the class before, only designed it, here's my (hopefully specific enough) question:Will students lose anything in their understanding of and proficiency with Java, especially in terms of the AP Exam, if the class only uses a command-line environment for program compilation and execution?There are many pros/cons to one IDE over another -- a topic which I think is too broad for this community. I just want to make sure, from those who have experience with this course, if there's something that the command-line environment lacks for students that an IDE like BlueJ doesn't lack. I don't want to end up doing students a disservice with respect to the objectives of the course based on this decision.Edit: Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE, which makes it ideal for my 1:1 Chromebook environment (however, I do have access to a PC lab for additional software, so that is not a restricting factor for me). As they define it, ""Cloud9 combines a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu workspace in the cloud."" You essentially get a text editor and a terminal for compiling and running programs. I've found that anything I can do via a Linux command line, I can do in Cloud9. It has a number of additional features that make it great for classroom use. I originally chose it because it's the environment used for the CS50 IDE. See more here.",2017-05-25 04:42:03,76,True,743,7,0,3,"['java', 'ap-computer-science-a', 'ide', 'command-line']",2,False

Another difficult topic -- although a slightly more advanced one -- is pointers. (I'm thinking particularly of programming in C.) With this question I'm wondering if part of the difficulty is the syntactic sugar in C that allows the following to be equivalent:With array notation, we are explicit with 0-indexing, but the logic of it isn't apparent. Yet, with pointer arithmetic, it's more clear (I think...) why we use 0: the pointer stores the base address, so dereferencing the pointer brings us to that address which is where the array logically begins.Comfort with this leads to the topic of memory management on the heap with something like this:I am toying with expanding my introduction on arrays next year to include this particular use of pointers. I recognize that it would involve taking roughly a single lesson on arrays and expanding to something closer to a week-long series to tie all of these ideas together.However, is it worth putting aside the syntactic sugar in order to understand more accurately the indexing of arrays? On the other hand, does the introduction of pointers and memory complicate the process so much so that confusion about arrays will increase rather than decrease?

Ideally I think a large-ish scale project would be the best assessment of where the kids are. But two hours just isn't enough time. I'm not a fan of throwing 2 hours worth of multiple choice questions at students. Sure, I could probably come up with 75 or 100 multiple choice tracing questions. Make sure there are some recursive tracings and it could easily hit 2 hours.The other side though is coming up with a coding assignment that is doable in 2 hours. To do that you'd probably have a few of the upper students finishing in 15 minutes. Sort of the same issue as the discussion we had a few days ago on students finishing labs quickly. I normally do a hybrid of the two, and it works okay. A multiple choice section that should take about half the period and a couple of simple coding questions for the other half.

72,342,What makes imperative programming easier or harder to learn?,"In my experience, people who have programmed before, whether they're professional or not, almost always consider imperative programming to be obvious. They're usually skeptical that a concept such as variable assignment could be difficult to learn.On the other hand, in my limited experience (teaching Programming 101, and with people learning to write simple scripts), students who are beginning to learn about programming do find the concept difficult. Given a program likemany students struggle with the concept that print(x) will not print 3 even if some_condition() is true. Writing assignment using = may make the difficulty more widespread.Is difficulty with imperative programming correlated with certain backgrounds? For example, do students with a strong mathematical background struggle more because they have some prior concept of equality? Do students with more computer time struggle less because they're more used to the concept of a state change (even if they can't formulate it in these terms of course)?",2017-06-01 21:23:50,124,True,"1,159",16,1,4,"['imperative-programming', 'programming-paradigms']",3,False

105,498,Homework Policy for Advanced/Honors Students,"Perusing Twitter just now, I saw this tweet from the @CSTeachingTips account, and it got me thinking about the general topic of homework as it applies to our discipline:Downsize homework because, like a job, students should be able to do
  the work during business hours.I personally struggled a lot with what and how much homework to assign my AP students this past year. I wanted it to be effective and not just ""homework-for-homework's-sake.""I found students worked more effectively on coding when I was in the room and they could ask for help. If they hit a brick wall at home, they were stuck until a) they got to class the next day or b) they received an email from me (presuming they took the time to send one and I got it in time to reply in a timely manner). On the other hand, the content required in an AP class, especially CS50 AP, seems to necessitate some work be done at home. There's a lot to cover, and class minutes are at a premium, so if homework can reinforce the day's work and/or give a head start for the next day, it's worth it. Yet, as with the tweet's sentiment, I want to honor the lives of students outside of just my classroom.For my question, I'm thinking particularly of honors-level HS students (either AP CSP or AP CS A - I think this would apply roughly equally to both). What homework assignments do you and your students find beneficial?

Even if they believe that I (the teacher) strongly believe it is bad practice, they won't ""internalize"" this.My current strategy is elegantly forgetting about jump statements altogether. I don't tell them these things exist, hoping by the time they discover, they'll be used to coding right. Not only Goto, but also loop or subroutine/function exit statements (although I do use these from time to time in the darkness of my room, but I always feel dirty when doing so).Should I teach them jump statements?

Such conventions exist to make it easier for others to read and makes it possible for them to understand what it does, without too much effort. If the students understood why the conventions exist and the reasons for writing easy-to-read code, they would write code which is easier to review. So my question is how can I teach the students the need for those conventions, so that they understand why it's important to write code that is easy to review.I'd rather they didn't lose points in tests for not following conventions, because then they do learn the conventions but they don't understand the reason for those conventions.",2017-06-09 11:14:07,150,True,709,8,1,4,['coding-style'],15,False
109,514,Analogy for abstract classes,"Abstract classes are peculiar things.  Consider:The classic way to explain them is to say that they are like interfaces, but can implement methods.  But explaining this way seems counter to their essential nature, and forces us to devolve into a series of random-factoid comparisons between interfaces and Abstract classes.  (Interestingly, the JavaDoc commits this particular sin.)  At no point in that discussion do we even try to get at the intuitive heart of what abstract classes really are.On the other hand, classes can also be declared ""abstract"" even if everything is fully implemented and there are no abstract methods at all, which the programmer can do simply to make sure that the class cannot be instantiated directly.  This lends itself to a different kind of explanation.  We could say that ""Abstract classes represent abstract ideas, so that means that we can't instantiate them, and they can declare methods that must be implemented by child-classes.""  But, of course, they can have constructor methods.  This seems mysterious until you realize that they are instantiated during constructor-chaining, so saying that they can't ever be instantiated is really not true.I can think of no explanation for abstract classes that really gets to their essential nature.

I want them to use the eGit plugin because if I ask them to use the command line, they will never do it. Researching this, the stock advice seems to be to set up the repository outside of the Eclipse project.

160,961,How to overcome the TDD/BDD time fallacy,"I've observed an unusual thing happen when teachers try to introduce Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to their classes. Even though the teachers invariably encourage it and present it as a useful strategy, students come out of the class with mixed feelings or actively opposed to using TDD/BDD in the future.The reason they give for this is time. And in a way, it makes sense. TDD and BDD have high upfront setup costs in selecting framework (e.g. JUnit or Cucumber), adding test hooks/libraries into the code (your import org.junit.Tests), thinking up test cases for all the various scenarios, and then of course actually writing all the tests themselves.In industry, this isn't so bad, because tests are essentially infinitely reusable, so the cost of that work can be amortized over months or even years. For a class project though, the entire thing from start to finish is only going to be a handful of weeks long at best. So the students see all of the cost and only a small slice of the benefit.In short, students sort of pick up on a perverse incentive to not use TDD/BDD because the benefits don't justify the cost. So, how can I convince students that those strategies really are good choices, when simply forcing them to use them and saying ""it works better in the real world, I promise"" isn't cutting it?I've seen How to stress the importance of testing code?, but the answer there is just ""use TDD.""

162,992,Can sharing learning stats be beneficial to guide beginner students?,"The main consensus in most compsci programs I have been at is that a sizable amount of students is inherently unable to learn how to code. An old entry on Jeff Atwood's blog summarizing the issue cites this 2006 article by Saeed Dehnadi and Richard Bornat, claiming:Formal logical proofs, and therefore programs – formal logical proofs that particular computations
  are possible, expressed in a formal system called a programming language – are utterly meaningless.
  To write a computer program you have to come to terms with this, to accept that whatever you
  might want the program to mean, the machine will blindly follow its meaningless rules and come to
  some meaningless conclusion. In the test the consistent group showed a pre-acceptance of this fact:
  they are capable of seeing mathematical calculation problems in terms of rules, and can follow those
  rules wheresoever they may lead. The inconsistent group, on the other hand, looks for meaning
  where it is not. The blank group knows that it is looking at meaninglessness, and refuses to deal
  with it.It even goes on as to propose some of the prospective students to be advised away from compsci courses:There is a test for programming aptitude, or at least for success in a first programming course. We
  have speculated on the reasons for its success, but in truth we don’t understand how it works any
  more than you do.Today, I found a retraction from Richard Bonat, claiming his conclusions were affected by his mental health issues:Though it’s embarrassing, I feel it’s necessary to explain how and why I came to write “The camel has two
  humps” and its part-retraction in (Bornat et al., 2008). It’s in part a mental health story.In autumn 2005 I became clinically depressed. My physician put me on the then-standard treatment for
  depression, an SSRI. But she wasn’t aware that for some people an SSRI doesn’t gently treat depression,
  it puts them on the ceiling. I took the SSRI for three months, by which time I was grandiose, extremely
  self-righteous and very combative – myself turned up to one hundred and eleven. I did a number of very
  silly things whilst on the SSRI and some more in the immediate aftermath, amongst them writing “The
  camel has two humps”. I’m fairly sure that I believed, at the time, that there were people who couldn’t learn
  to program and that Dehnadi had proved it. The paper doesn’t exactly make that claim, but it comes pretty
  close. Perhaps I wanted to believe it because it would explain why I’d so often failed to teach them. It was
  an absurd claim because I didn’t have the extraordinary evidence needed to support it. I no longer believe
  it’s true.I've been a TA for compsci courses in three colleges and, in all of them, transparency was a core value: past exams, classes, and grades were made available from the very beginning. Failure rates were never lower than 30%, often beating failure rates for subjects widely regarded as more difficult, such as physics or calculus. On the one hand, some students might feel discouraged to put in the effort to learn knowing that they have a high likelihood of failing. On the other hand, it might be beneficial for them to know hiccups are expected and perhaps compsci might not be the way for them.My questions are: do students benefit from knowing most of them will likely fail the subject?

It's a very difficult class, and it only attracts kids who are really enthusiastic about delving deep into the bowels of gdb, stackframes, format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflow attacks, and the like. 1 At the beginning, I give a short lecture talking about ethics.  The basic analogy that I draw is to a locksmith: a good locksmith can get into your car, and can get into your house. But an honest locksmith does not, because the lock that is in place communicates that he or she is not supposed to enter.  Thus, a good lock is there to keep out honest people.2 From there, we arrive at this fine distinction: if a security feature is designed to keep you out, even if that security feature is very poorly implemented, then it is almost always unethical to circumvent it. Therefore, we should only study hacking using ""practice locks"", such as programs in our virtual machines.The question, then, is is this a sufficient message to impart?  If not, what more need be said?  Bear in mind that it is not actually a course in ethics per se.  I really can't spare more than about 15-20 minutes to impart the most important ideas, so I really want to make that short time count.¹  The course largely emphasizes security holes from the 90's and the 00's. This isn't to prevent them from being able to work in modern system, but because you can study the attacks we focus on in relatively pure forms using virtual machines from that time, so we don't have to spend time working around more advanced security features. And learning about those attacks in any depth is already plenty hard!² The lock may not be effective against, say, a determined burglar. But it helps people who generally wish to stay honest avoid temptation and conquer moments of ethical weakness.

Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.
                Closed 4 years ago.I take it as the Prime Directive that I must teach every student in every class session. You may disagree, but I'm not asking to debate that question, but to look for how it might be accomplished, assuming it is, at least, a goal. This isn't about lecture, per se. I'm not sure I believe it is possible to teach everyone with just lecture, since we all learn differently. So this isn't about what ""level"" at which to pitch the course. Suppose you wanted to give something to everyone in every class period. How would you proceed?Let's assume that your class contains people of different background, preparation, and ability. Let's not assume that everyone needs to get the same thing out of each class, but something that will advance their own learning. Let's also assume that helping those with little motivation is not the main issue. I'm also not looking for a way that guarantees the result, but for techniques that make it highly likely to be achieved. I have some ideas about this, of course. Active Learning is my big hammer. Teamwork also. Paired learning (not just pair programming) maybe, though I'd love to hear from anyone who has experimented with that (either successfully or unsuccessfully). I've done Paired Teaching with a co-instructor in which each of us does different things and takes control at different times, with different students likely preferring one of us over the other.I once had two students who had failed a compiler course, never having had a positive educational experience land at the very top of the class in the following term. The other students there, one of my highest performing groups ever (on technical issues anyway), were very angry, accusing me of putting ""ringers"" in the class to make them look bad. Note for the record that I have over 40 years of teaching experience and still can only begin to approach this, though I do believe that it is the prime directive. Nothing in the Academia list seems similar to this, and I'm interested in CS specific ideas. I think it would be  different in, say, teaching Russian Language, or Poetry. I'm not looking for a definitive answer, but for ideas for how to structure the whole teaching process so that you reach everyone. But I'm also not looking for debate, but for practical suggestions.

I think a strong theoretical base is extremely important and I greatly enjoyed the modules I took at university which covered this sort of theory.Most courses do include a practical aspect, though. One of my frustrations as a student who started at university with experince in professional software engineering in industry, was that a lot of the more practical content was incredibly outdated, not in line with industry best practices or just downright irrelevant.As a concrete example, I took a web development module in 2015 which focussed on PHP 4, taught us to write code riddled with XSS, CSRF and SQLi vulnerabilities and didn't place any emphasis on architecture design. Some parts of the course were useful (such as the primer on how HTTP works at a protocol level) but it was obvious the same slide deck had been reused year after year and I came away feeling like I'd wasted my time. Some of these details seem to be out of the lecturer's hands and determined by the department, but the end result is still the same. I do realise web is perhaps one of the worst areas for this, but it's equally applicable when e.g. introducing Java and not covering the ""new"" generics support, or the more functional features in Java 8.

I think trying to keep up with each new shiny JavaScript framework that becomes momentarily popular is unrealistic and useful for neither student nor educator - but there must be some middle ground.

Note: I've experimented with Cloud9 in both online and onsite instruction, with different results. This question is about students working onsite, side-by-side.Background:Extensive use of pair programming in the K-12 environment is best practice over solo programming. Pair programming increases persistence and engagement, and reduces frustration and boredom. See for example Hanks et al. (2011) Pair programming in education: A literature review. Computer Science Education 21:2.Schools are increasingly using Chromebooks, which preclude a locally installed IDE.

Under what circumstances is it legal and ethical to use a superficial scan with protocol-adhering requests to scan a target that is not your own?Portscanning a school district's web or mail server is likely to be regarded as hostile under any circumstances without working with the school's IT department. Students are likely to do so if they know about such a tool, even if warned about the consequences.The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) makes it a felony to access computer resources that are not your own without written permission from the owner if such access causes $5000 damage or more. The CFAA identifies as damages the cost to investigate any potentially unauthorized use and harden the resource against such future access.No one has ever been found guilty under the CFAA for portscanning, but only one judge has ever ruled on the matter and it is considered ambiguous under the law if it involves thousands of ports across thousands of computers, especially if the scan uses requests that do not conform to the expectations of the protocol at each corresponding port.Ports and protocols are important concepts early in a student's learning.

It seems common to teach to some perceived ideal level, especially in courses that depend fundamentally on traditional lecture. Some teachers focus on the best students, hoping the ""average"" students will do ok and largely ignoring the less-than-average. Some teach to ""the middle"" - at least, as they perceive it. Few seem to aim for the bottom, leaving the best students to learn on their own. I want to give everyone something to advance their learning in each class period. Not everyone in a course will want or need the same things.  I want to give them each the things that they will judge valuable. I have a few ideas, most involving active learning techniques and student teams, following a structure into which each student can fit their own goals, and find satisfaction achieving those goals. Traditional A-F grading is a poor vehicle for this. I don't think spending a lot of effort on reaching the unreachable is productive. Some students will be in your class for the wrong reasons and may be uninterested in any reasonable of success. To make this achievable, make the following assumptions: The somewhat transcendental question is: How can I convince others to reach for this goal?

Often this is phrased as Delivering Content, or Completing the Syllabus. The traditional picture, whether valid or not, is an instructor (single) broadcasting Content to students (multiple). I wonder if this is a common view of CS education. In a course like Data Structures, there a lot of things (content) that the student has to learn: Stacks, Sets, Trees, ... along with common algorithms. Normally there is a syllabus that lists all these things in some rational order. ""Covering it"" is a sort of meta-constraint (or sometimes a hard constraint) on the instructor. In the compiler course, the Content is more about technique than facts, of course, but those techniques possibly are the content: scanning, parsing, ...So, I guess the question that I would most like advice on here is:If you could order your goals in a typical undergrad course where
  would ""Deliver
  the Content"" fit? High, Low? What, if anything, would be above it? What would be the effect on your students if you move that goal up? down? remove it altogether?

Most Intro to CS teachers (I think) do not delve with breadth and depth into details of how variable names are tied to data and datatype. As a result, some students create pieces of their own mental model of how the computer is storing these variable names, data, and data type. What mental models of memory storage in general (and for sequences in particular) are typical in students who learn Python first vs. students who learn another language first- one that treats arrays more like C does?BackgroundSeveral single-university studies (e.g. Jayal et al. 2015) have found that a post-secondary sequence that starts out with Python and then transitions to Java performs as well as a sequence that starts in Java. Another question asks how to optimize that transition.Python has particular elements that do not correspond well to Java, however. Negative indices (with which a=[1, 2, 4, 6] means that a[-1] is 6) and slices (with which a[1:3] is [2, 4]) are commonly found in code students stumble upon on the Internet, making it somewhat useful to mention these language features when teaching about lists and strings.Python's native types don't include a type in which pointer arithmetic can be exploited for speed, though the numpy library offers an array. I suspect that when students learn about Java arrays, they probably build a mental model that fairly closely matches how arrays are stored in memory in C. Python does not actually store lists in a sequence of equally sized memory blocks; [3, 'a', 5.2] is a perfectly valid list. Does the mixed-type sequence or slicing or negative indexing in Python change a student's initial mental model for lists, arrays, and other sequences?",2017-07-02 21:57:54,765,True,478,13,4,3,"['java', 'python', 'variables']",6,False

Perhaps more important is what else do you need to do in structuring your course to make up for any disadvantages or support any advantages. These might involve ensuring fairness in sharing work or in grading. I tend to use it at every level, but there may be issues you see in various courses. The answers seem to indicate a fair amount of misunderstanding of Pair Programming. It is not just two people assigned to a task. That can lead to division of labor, which often fails. If two people just divide up the work and do it unwisely, they have the additional task of integrating their work which can be very difficult. Neither is it one person just working and the other just ""reviewing"". It is a much more cooperative endeavor.

Further, there is usually no way to see the exam script or any form of mark scheme or question breakdown, which makes it difficult to improve in the general context of the university degree. The summative exam does nothing other than provide a coarse measure of the candidate's performance during the exam.Is this sort of status quo widespread throughout undergraduate level CS, and what can be done to give students the opportunity to learn from and reflect on these sort of assessments?

That table might be printed on the screen and disappear, or it might be stored in to a new table, or it could be used to update an existing table, or it could be used as input to a program which could do… anything. But, it is a two-dimensional table, and nothing more.I think that this is the very first concept that needs to lodge in their awareness if they are to make any progress at all.

222,1463,Unit Review for boolean algebra,"This is the first unit in junior year for a course in theoretical computer science.  Prior to this, the students have already had AP CS A and a mish-mash of other topics.  They have, by this point, studied:This course, then, is a year of theoretical computer science.  The first unit is background mathematics that they will need during the rest of the course, and it focuses on boolean algebra and sets.  The requested Unit Review here is for my boolean algebra opening.The general goals are to help the students gain serious familiarity with algebraic manipulations and with the symbols themselves.  After these lessons, we will move onto Conjunctive and Disjunctive Normal Forms, fairly substantial algebraic manipulations involving 5-10 steps, and then into logic gates for a gentle introduction to computer circuitry, so it is important that they come out prepared for that.Word of warning: The unit below has some serious weaknesses, as you will see.  Please be gentle!  This year will be my second time giving these lessons, and while I have made a series of improvements from what I did this last September, there is still a long way to go.  There is a lot of lecture, and I would really like to make it more engaging when I do it again27.Lesson one:We begin our foray into boolean algebra by converting our Java boolean symbols to formal math symbology: && to $\land$, || to $\lor$, and ! to $\lnot$.  We then discuss how != is essentially $\oplus$, and begin our discussion of $\Longleftrightarrow$ as being a near approximation of == (with a promise that we will come back to this again, because we are not done with it yet). We then introduce tautologies (such as $B \lor \lnot B$), and go over their truth tables.  I finally provide them with an extremely short homework worksheet where they have to circle the boolean statements that are tautologies.  (It also provides practice with all of the symbols we have discussed)Lesson two:We review lesson 1, and then introduce the concept of contradictions as the opposite of tautologies, go over their truth tables, and look at the obvious contradiction $B \land \lnot B$.I ask them to create two tautologies with a partner, the more creative the better, walk around, and ask for a number of students to write interesting ones on the board.We move on to $A \Rightarrow B$, discuss its meaning and truth table, and then ask what in Java is similar?  I first propose:We talk about this for awhile, and talk about why, though it may seem like a reasonable choice at first, it is not really the same idea.  We then spend some time on the hardest idea of implies: what we mean when we say that $False \Rightarrow True$ is $True$.At this point, I take a break to introduce the way I approach proofs in this class.  Over the course of the year, certain very important proofs must be reproduced by a student chosen at random during the following period.  This forces the students not to ignore these proofs, and helps them to internalize both the mathematical symbols that I need them to gain fluency with, and some very clever proof techniques.I spend a substantial chunk of time then doing a formal proof that $False \Rightarrow True \equiv True$.  I finish the class with a second, informal, and intuitive proof of the same (which they will not need to reproduce.)Lesson 3:We review from the prior day, and a student is called up to reproduce the proof.  We then spend about 15 minutes going over necessary and sufficient in depth, and re-examine both $\Longleftrightarrow$ and $\Rightarrow$ through this new lense.  During this process, I introduce $\Longleftrightarrow$ more properly as $(A \Rightarrow B) \land (A \Leftarrow B)$ and as iff, and we talk about the similarities that $\Longleftrightarrow$ shares with $\equiv$.I go over DeMorgan's Laws, and briefly cover 5 more symbols: ∀, ∃, |, ∈, and ∴.At this point, I give them English statements to translate to mathematical statements, and mathematical statements to translate to English statements, one at a time.  We use the following format: I provide an exercise, they work on it with a buddy or on their own while I bounce around the room offering help, and then I go over how we do it.  The final exercise is to translate Goldbach's Conjecture (which I do not identify to them until after the translation work is done) from boolean symbology into English:$\forall n|n \gt 2 \wedge (\frac{n}{2}) \in \mathbb{N}$, $\exists (m,ℓ)\,\,|\,\, m \in P \wedge ℓ \in P \wedge m+ℓ=n$As they leave, I give them a homework assignment with practice problems in very simple 1- or 2-step boolean algebraic reductions (including applying DeMorgan's Law), translating statements from English back and forth into symbols, creating truth tables from algebraic statements, and creating algebraic statements from truth tables.This is my opener for the year, and it is so. very. dry.  There is also very little activity!  I am already aware that I've got a real snoozer here.This material must to come first in the year for large-scale organizational reasons, but I would really like ideas to make it more engaging.

I essentially explained that things declared in the static space are global to the project and belong to a class as posed to instances.

Explaining how the Web works in a concise yet effective manner that sticks has been my biggest challenge so far.Any suggestions?Update:For the first lecture, I ended up using a combination of all suggestions. I used Code.org's videos, but they turned to be a bit too lengthy for the attention spans of my students, so in the next opportunity, I will address this a bit differently.I will not go in depth into how the Internet works and how the data is transferred, but I will use the buses/highways analogy more superficially or even as an add-on explanation instead. I may go into what the DNS is, but that's about it.In a Front-End Web Development course that only goes as far as using JavaScript with JQuery, potentially touching on a little bit of what is AJAX, the extra details are unnecessary, so rather than focusing on how the Internet works, I can focus on how Web sites work, or more specifically, what happens behind the scenes from the moment you type in ""www.google.com"" in the web browser, until the web page is rendered and ready to consume.The most important bit for my students, perhaps, is to be aware that every asset on a page involves a new request, something more that must be downloaded. And that every element in your HTML document must be ""translated"" and drawn by the browser. Thus, it is all these assets that must be gathered, and the number of elements to draw onto the browser tab or window, that we need to take into account when developing these pages, because the more of them we have, the longer it takes for the browser to load or update the page.",2017-07-07 15:19:03,1770,True,609,6,0,5,"['lesson-ideas', 'teaching-analogy', 'resource-request']",3,False

228,1509,What should a teacher do with information about plagiarism before the final submission,"As probably we all experience, plagiarism is very common in CS. I know that there are several types of plagiarism ranging from simply submitting a copy of the colleagues’ code to other highly sophisticated mechanisms. In my experience, the most common is indeed the simplest one. The student just grabs the code from another colleague and eventually change the names of the variable, and submits the solution (some students don’t even do that!).While there are several systems that are easily capable of detecting this type of plagiarism, they do it mainly when the student submits the final version of the code. Some other tools, are capable of detect plagiarism and notify the student about that (as if they didn’t already know that!). 
In most cases the use of an anti-plagiarism tool will act mainly to support punitive measures. Although it is not the main focus, as part of my PhD work, I am working in a tool that analyses the source code as it is being written and is able to detect plagiarism in “real-time”. This way, the teacher can be notified about students that are performing plagiarism even before their final solution is submitted, giving the teacher time to act and avoid the punitive measures.My biggest question is: What should the teacher do with that information?

I have no experience with CS jobs outside academia, and I'm starting to worry the letters I'm writing are too long (though I do have a good track record of students getting what they applied for). First question (with an eye towards CS internships or jobs especially):(1) How long are your letters of recommendation?Another question is scalability. Each letter I write takes me about 1 hour, and the original templates took longer (probably 3-4 hours each).

231,2530,Review of Information Theory Lab,"This is mid-year in a course for HS juniors in theoretical computer science.  The unit is about Information Theory.  We were using the coin-weighing problem as something of a motivator for the entire enterprise, as a deep understanding of that problem would also engender a pretty reasonable understanding of the purpose and use of the four axioms of Information Theory:In the lectures prior to this lab, we cover the coin problem, the axioms themselves, some of the derived properties of the axioms, bits, trits (including the Soviet Setun computers), nats, and Hartleys, how much information is present in random and constrained events, the concept or entropy, and how to calculate the storage requirements of a theoretically maximal lossless data compression given some set of rules.In covering the coin problem itself, we actually visit it three times, spread out among the lessons above.  At first, I simply introduce the problem and have the kids try to solve it for some small numbers of coins.  Later, we revisit the coin problem and show how we would solve some larger problems, and draw some generalized conclusions from these solutions.  Finally, at our third visit, we derive a generalized algorithm for what steps you could use to figure out a next optimal weighing.The lab is in Scheme, and asks students to create a function that provides the proper weighings to solve a game.  The entire lab write-up comes in at a whopping 8 pages, so I won't put that all here, but this is the opening that describes the problem:Your goal is to create a function called playgame that takes arguments like so:(define sampleGame '((u . 1) (u . 2) (u . 3) (u . 4) (G . 5)))
(playgame 4 'H sampleGame)In the game example above, the real answer is that coin 4 is heavy.  But coming into the problem, coins 1-4 are unknown, and coin 5 is a reference coin.  The data encodings are like so:'u – unknown, could be light, heavy, or good
'l – could be light or good (heavy has been eliminated as a possibility)
'h – could be heavy or good (light has been eliminated as a possibility)
'L – coin is Light.  This is a final answer state.
'H – coin is Heavy.  This is a final answer state.
'G – coin is good.All games with 'G are considered to be equivalent, so a designation of no false coins can be made with any coin number.The function call above would have an output like:
Game of ((u . 1) (u . 2) (u . 3) (u . 4) (G . 5))
With real answer that coin 4 is H
Move 0: (((u . 4) (u . 1)) ((G . 5) (u . 2)) ((u . 3)))
result: ((h . 4) (h . 1) (G . 5) (l . 2) (G . 3))
Move 1: (((h . 4)) ((h . 1)) ((G . 5) (l . 2) (G . 3)))
result: ((H . 4) (G . 1) (G . 5) (G . 2) (G . 3))
Game finished in 2 movesThere are many possible ways to get the answer.  In your lab, don’t be concerned with whether you are weighing coin 4 vs coin 1 instead of coin 2 versus coin 4.  What matters is that every move is legal, and that your weighings will always find the answer within the minimum number of steps.  What follows on that same page is a recap (and explanation) of the algorithm for figuring out the next move that we derived together in class.The lab itself turned out to be extremely difficult, even when I did it on my own.  I don't like to shrink back from course targets.  I would prefer to scaffold until every student can meet the goal.  So, I had to find a way to make it more manageable.  I arrived at the following strategy, which I confess I thought quite innovative at the time:I created the lab itself in segments, each with more hints, discussion, and code organization.  If you ultimately read through the entire lab write-up, you would eventually the method header and description for every one of the 28 functions in my own personal (idiosyncratic) solution, as well as additional hints, thoughts, and alerts to some programming traps.At the bottom of each section, I had a message like this: If you stop here and complete the problem correctly, you will be able to earn 100%. 
  If you go on to the next page, you will only be able to earn 94%.The notion was to allow for self-selected scaffolding to make the lab more possible. The earnings per section were originally set to 105, 100, 94, and 80.  (The big gap for the last section was because the last section basically just laid out every little detail.)  This setup, I believed, would provide a challenge to those who could handle it, and support for those who needed.How things went downWhen the lab went live, it did not go at all as I expected.  The students at my highly selective school were far, far more resistant to going on to the next section than I had anticipated, and preferred instead to work at a level that was inappropriately hard.  Most students refused to go below 100% for any reason whatsoever, and the students who could really have benefited from the 80% section would not go past 94%.  Some students never completed the lab at all, ironically garnering a zero in an attempt to avoid a 94%.More perturbing to me were assertions that there were other students who were cheating, since the sections you actually read were on your own honor.  My protestations that my solution was, in fact, highly idiosyncratic (and therefore it would be easy to tell) did nothing to dispel this idea.  Later, upon analysis, I did find at least one student who definitely did read beyond the section that he declared, but that was all I was able to find.This whole episode took a tremendous amount of class time, and ate substantially into the good will I had built over the last two years with the class.Innovation?  Meet near-abject failure.I have already made a pass at addressing some of the problems the kids identified for this next school year.  First of all, I have integrated the coin problem far more tightly into the lecture materials.  I have further added new hints and clarifications across the entire text of the lab, and I have changed the point values for the sections to: 105, 100, 96, and 90.With these modifications, the lab will be incrementally better on a number of fronts.  However, I can't help but think that my approach is foundationally wrong here.  I don't see how to entirely avoid many of the problems that I encountered the first time.How can I scaffold the lab more appropriately without retreating on the final product?  I believe that the exercise has real value, and I don't want to simply retreat into lab material that is inherently less rich.",2017-07-09 22:54:17,27,True,151,6,0,2,"['labs', 'materials-review', 'information-theory']",1,False
232,2532,Working with students with specific secondary skill,"I often see students at levels varying from really bad to incredibly clever.

Yet, it is clear that all students have another field/skill ( often not related to computers) which they are remarkably good in that field. For example one of the students has a musical understanding such as I have never seen (as an example of this, he can create piano adaptions for Green Day songs and says it was ""easy"").These skills are neither a hindrance nor do they aid the students, but that doesn't have to be the case. For the students are not too good in Computer science, their ""secondary"" skill might be useful for aiding them. I have not been able to think of a good way to use their secondary skills to assist them in learning computer science.

233,2537,What are good models for an Honors Program for CS students?,"One way to extend the reach of your best students is to have an Honors Program that, perhaps, runs over several years. One model is to have a special program to which students are invited. Participation extends over several years, perhaps with separate classes. If you have experience with such a program, either as a participant, faculty member, or creator, what was the model and what worked and didn't in your program.I was a faculty member for students in one such program but had little influence on its general structure. Students could designate any course(s) in the curriculum as honors option. If the professor agreed, then the student and prof made a mini contract for extra work in the class. This was sort of small scale from my perspective but worked well in my (limited) experience. There were no special lectures for these students and the other students weren't affected. The honors student had to do more to earn an A in the course, but that was part of the contract. I had to design a more complex project for the (compiler course) students was the only real difference. When I was an undergrad at a liberal arts college we had a general honors program. I studied math and philosophy, but the program was tailored to the liberal arts. Students were invited at the end of the first year (of four). A faculty committee was responsible for invitations, though I suspect that a student could petition for entry. Every term the program had a different theme, literature, science, psychology, history, etc. depending on faculty interest. The students read a book on the topic of the term each week and met in seminar for a few hours once a week. The faculty said little as the students discussed the book. At the end of the second year of the program (third year of study) one of the seminars was public, held in an auditorium, with a reception following. These were well attended. The final year was different. We developed a ""thesis"" paper in our major study area, so mine was in the philosophy of math area. Since my major was fairly narrow (but also required science study) I cam away with a nearly perfect Liberal Arts education. The only area of the Medieval University course of study that I missed was Astronomy. However, the honors courses were in addition to the regular student load. The courses were pretty intense, so could lead to burnout. Also, someone already studying, say philosophy, didn't get as much ""broadening"" as I did since they already studied many of the HP topics anyway. I liked that Honors Program model, then and now, but here I'm more interested in something specialized for Computer Science students. I think that both small scale and large scale programs are interesting and might serve as models for others to consider. Much later, I helped design a doctoral program in computing that had many features of the above honors model. Three years, two of study and one of dissertation. The years were calendar years with no breaks and dissertation topics were expected to be ready to go by the beginning of the third year. My personal context is the United States where undergraduates take many courses in many fields with one chosen as a specialty. My examples are from the US of course. However, other places, in which students are much more specialized as undergraduates have, in my view, similar needs: foster a good learning environment for the best students who want to go beyond and can use faculty guidance.

All* objects in Swing are children of objects in AWT. Also explain the Component class object.Show that Container essentially contains (hence the fancy name) other Components and that creates a GUI.Show the students a simple GUI for a chat application (no server-client, just the gui!) which composes of a JButton, JTextField (for entering messages), JTextPane (chat history) and JLabel. This step includes showing them the code.let them work for the remaining time (45 mins plus 45-time_it_took_to_get_to_this_step) on creating a gui of their own, of their choosing, which can have any Swing object they find. The GUI must have JLabel, JButton and JTextField. Other than that, go wild.This lesson shows absolutely nothing about what Java does in the background for the GUI. I am talking about the intensive OOP the goes on in the JFrame class, and the incredible flexibility with everything extending JContainer (allows JButton, JLabel and many others to be treated almost identically).How could I extends one (or more) of the above steps, or possibly add a new one, that will teach these parts of java GUI?

They are essentially the same (but not 100% equivalent. Concurrent modifications is something beginners aren't ready for). So I am uncertain about the order of the subjects.Secondly: Functions. Again, why? I want to remove them from the curriculum (students learn about them in the following years anyway, as part of OOP), but this might do more damage than good. Students might want to know, after an entire year, what exactly is the meaning of the public static void main from lesson 1.Functions can explain that, but other than that, it's pointless at this stage (because they'll learn it anyway, should they major in CS).So, does the order of subjects in the curriculum, as it stands, make sense (keeping in mind that arrays are not covered at all)?Note: this question is not a duplicate of this one, simply because I already have a curriculum, and I am asking for a review of it.

283,2933,How to teach students to work with multiple layers of abstraction?,"I'm currently preparing to teach a course on data structures and algorithms. In my past experiences helping teach similar courses, I've noticed that many students find it challenging to ""hold multiple layers of abstraction"" in their head. This problem manifests in several different ways:To help make this more concrete, I'll pick a specific lesson/assignment I'm developing: having students implement a hashmap with separate chaining as a part of a larger project (in Java).In order to successfully implement just the hashmap, students need to understand that the hashmap has several different ""layers"" of abstraction.And of course, once they're done, students need to successfully use the data structures they've written to complete some other task which might have even more layers of abstraction.Ideally, I want students to develop the ability to selectively ""abstract"" and ignore different parts of a project when implementing something to reduce mental overhead. Some students seem to intuitively grok this idea but others instead try and hold the entire data structure (or project!) in their head, have a compulsive need to read all instructor provided code, etc, and quickly become overwhelmed. In this particular case, I've observed students seem prone to becoming confused by where the hashing logic lives, or losing sight of what the map ADT is asking them to implement in the first place.Some of this is certainly solvable by just explaining hashmap more effectively, but my core question is this: What are some strategies for helping students become more comfortable working with multiple layers of abstraction? How can I help students develop the meta-skill of being comfortable with abstraction?I'd welcome answers discuss potential strategies in context of this hashmap example as well as answers that address the more general question.",2017-07-25 00:20:12,732,True,473,12,1,4,"['undergraduate', 'data-structure']",0,False

All tests are written on paper, but the questions on the test are subject to changes, and those are the changes being asked about.These students are in a CS major in High School.Besides asking them to write recursive functions for a variety of purposes (tree traversal\search etc.), their knowledge is also tested by asking them to trace by hand (on paper, without a computer) a given recursive function (usually one that does string manipulations).For example:and it is called in some main:This is an example for how their tracing should look like (this image is not related to the permutation example above, but it serves to explain how they trace the recursion)They essentially trace the call stack (and they know this; they know that effectively that's what they are doing).However, I have some doubts about this method of testing (specifically the tracing).So, would testing students like this be useful? By that I mean: does it actually indicate understanding of recursion and\or increase their ability to understand recursive functions they see?If not, then how else can their knowledge of recursion be tested in a written test?The tests are given because that's how the students are taught:There's no bigger goal, no project that they use it in (yet).

For example, this fake expression:  behaves as if there are parentheses around expr2 AND expr3, but the ""tree view of precedence"" with AND being ""more"" would put the parentheses around the OR expression. I didn't explain my wrong idea to the students, but it is an error that I sometimes make in my thinking - it makes sense to me!Is there a better way of explaining precedence to avoid this ambiguity than to say ""it binds tightly""?I encountered this when teaching SQL, but the question is not really about Boolean operators or Math, it is about Precedence in general as implemented in many languages.

I used to get confused, stammer, blush, etc. But now I just pause and notice that something is incorrect, then correct it if I can figure it out, or say that I will get back to it.In one of my questions on this site, I said that I taught something wrongly and a student raised a question about it. I stopped and said I would sort it out, but didn't try then to correct it because I wasn't sure why I had made the mistake. The students have a very limited capacity to handle ambiguous or conflicting info while they are learning new things, so I usually try to say only what is essential at the moment. Dijkstra wrote about ""the limited size of our skulls"" and I mention that frequently.My skull is definitely limited, and I forget more than I know at any given moment. So every year I need to refresh my memory of details. That is why if something doesn't work or I can't recall something then I demonstrate how to find it again or figure it out. Every year the software changes, the textbook is different, I am using different teaching notes or web sites, and on and on, so I am never completely on top of what is about to be shown in class. I used to reprimand myself, try to prepare better, make more notes, try out all the examples first and so on, but really, the workplace (to which they are going) is not a rehearsal, so I am ""modeling what I am teaching"".

292,2970,How to teach algorithms: implementation or application?,"One unit of CS50 AP's curriculum focuses on three main sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort. There is also discussion of something more efficient like merge sort. One programming assignment has students write the code in C to each of the three ""simpler"" sorting algorithms. Students get clear pseudocode of how each works, but they are left to work out the code on their own.In contrast I just started working through Princeton's excellent Algorithms course on Coursera (Algorithms, Part I). The first unit there focused on quick find, quick union, and weighted quick union. The algorithms -- both in pseudocode and in Java -- were given by the instructor; the programming assignment (Percolation) involved the correct use of weighted quick union. Rather than implement it, I just had to apply it with the provided class WeightedQuickUnionUF.Similar to the Princeton course, the AP CS A curriculum teaches sorting algorithms but only use thereof, not direct implementation (e.g. students are not expected on the exam to write insertion sort from memory). Instead, students have to understand it and be able to trace through steps in the sorting process.So there seem to be two approaches here (not limited to just sorting algorithms): teaching the challenge of coding an algorithm from scratch (via implementation) vs. giving students the algorithm to apply to a particular problem (via application). Is there a significant benefit in having students attempt to implement an algorithm from scratch?

If a student performs better than their ""natural abilities"" suggest then all is well, of course. However some students do less well than  they might simply because they think they aren't ""smart enough"" to do better.It is a well-known phenomenon, at least in the US, that some students do poorly in math because they have the belief that ""I can't do math."" Often enough, however it is just lack of exposure or poor teaching that got them to that belief. It might even be a single bad experience. The same is likely true in other technical subjects. For that matter, it may be true in most subjects, but it may also be that the problem is more likely to be overlooked in, say, History.The author of this believes that success comes from interest and hard work not natural ability, but that may not satisfy many students. In fact, saying ""you just need to work harder"" may increase their frustration, rather than their confidence.Of course a self-perceived lack of ability can easily lead to a lack of interest.The question, then, is:Some ideas might be interesting ways to speak to them, but hopefully many of you have seen this and have creative ways (exercises, teams, ..., anything) that can get a student to live beyond their self-perceived limitations.Authenticity Bias is a common phenomenon in recently promoted professionals who have new responsibilities. It is the sense of being a fraud in their new position. ""This isn't me, I'm playing a role."" Often the role demands behavior different from what they are comfortable with. Many, however, have found that not accepting the new role is a path to failure. Falling back on old habits, ""the real me"" simply fails in the new role.On the other hand, playing the new role consciously for a while can lead to a ""new me"", overcoming the Authenticity Bias.",2017-07-29 12:32:56,1293,True,"1,829",17,2,5,"['student-motivation', 'student-perceptions']",4,False

Structure of a scientific investigation. Hypotheses. Occam's razor. Controls. Correlation vs causation. Falsification. Examples such as intention to treat etc etc. Or is it more appropriate to teach Mathematical topics - matrix operations, algorithm analysis, complexity, logical expressions, etc etc.Or maybe a mixture of both?

We write the statement down, mark each item by its type, and then cross off areas of the statement (and write down the new types) as we walk through the evaluation.  This method has worked pretty consistently with my students at my day-job.However, lately I have begun tutoring an adult student who is having a great deal of trouble, and I have been struggling to break apart statements like the above examples in ways that he can parse and keep straight.He is at the right point, curricularly-speaking, to be examining them, but I am really struggling to help him trace and understand such statements.  (Ironically enough, because he can guess and modify a statement repeatedly, he can actually write statements like these with a fair amount of success, though when he is finished, he no longer fully understands them.)For various reasons, learning a small concept usually takes him 3-5 weeks.  This timescale is fine, it is simply the speed at which he operates.  However, this adds a constraint for me: approaches that I take to the material must lend themselves to a fair amount of repetition with only very minor variations, or they won't be effective.

Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.
                Closed 4 years ago.Bit of history: The Darmouth Basic Manual (1964) follows a common order of exposition: expressions, variables, constants, assignment, tests/loops; calling subprograms being considered an ""advanced topic"" (well, the last thing, after using tables).This reminds me of the first version of Fortran, (see preliminary report of 1954) which had no user-defined subroutines/functions at all.So teaching the importance of decomposing code into smaller (reusable) units was not considered a major priority.  And as a consequence we had generations of students who wrote functions/subprograms only under coercion.There's a recent paper (2016) about a procedure-oriented approach to teaching programming in C ; the question is, were there similar approaches in the sixties ot seventies?Question: Was this order of topics standard in the 1960s for imperative programming?  Bonus points if you can directly link to textbooks that demonstrate your answer.Remark: Counter-examples will certainly by found in the presentation of functional and LOGO programming. In Teaching Children Thinking, by S. Papers, 1971, page 5-2 it is shown that after demonstration of FORWARD 100 and ROTATELEFT 90, the student can write the first (endless recursive) procedureHere the procedural aspect comes even before variables, expressions etc.Partial answer:  the ACM Curricula Recommendations for Computer Science, vol 1 (1983) contains the 1968's course contents and outlines.

326,3199,Incorporating algorithmic complexity in grading,"What are some advantages of incorporating algorithmic complexity in grading tests and assignments given to students?Currently, students in 11th grade at my school are required in tests to write functions that should preform some operation (usually operations on data structures like LinkedList, Stack and Queue). This works fairly well in terms of checking whether a student knows how to use those data structures. However, it's not uncommon to see an answer that does, eventually, preform the required operation; and yet its complexity is $O(n^3)$ (no kidding. The specific case I'm thinking of is one where the student worked with the unsorted linked list of stacks1 in 3 nested for loops). The students are required, after they write their functions, to also write the complexity of their solutions.In a quest to improve the students' thinking skills, I thought that maybe we should give bonus points if the solutions are inventive and less complex than a head on approach. This means that if a student's function is $O(n)$ for a task that a direct assault would be of $O(n^2)$, they should get more points.This can also apply to various assignments we can give them, in addition to the tests we already have (or maybe make the tests slightly easier and then add assignments).The students are in a CS major, and they have experience with java, OOP, Data structures and basic calculations of complexity for various, simple, algorithms)1We gave them some arbitrary way of comparing stacks (of Integers): The sum of elements.",2017-08-10 16:11:32,150,True,207,5,0,3,"['grading', 'complexity-theory']",2,False

One strategy, of course, is to simply give them a list of things they ought to know -- there are many articles that give a good overview of topics covered by a standard CS degree, for example (example 1, example 2). However, this strategy doesn't generalize well: once you move on to trying to learn about something not on some list, you're back at square one.The other strategy I try suggesting is to just read random highly-upvoted posts on StackOverflow and news aggregate sites like Hacker News -- I've personally found you tend to pick up a good awareness of different CS and tech topics almost by osmosis if you do this. However, this strategy is also flawed: it's a random and slow process, and isn't guaranteed to be comprehensive.

I'd welcome both suggestions for encouraging pair programming in general as well as feedback on these specific ideas.Note that this is for a university-level class, and that due to time constraints, all homework needs to be done outside of the classroom (so I can't watch them pair program and offer suggestions or really enforce anything).",2017-08-17 04:08:22,732,True,244,7,0,2,"['undergraduate', 'project', 'pair-programming']",2,False

While simple apps can be created in moments, more complex ones involving enabling / disabling sets of controls, etc., can be fraught with unexpected complexity and paradox.What are some good initial projects for working with just the UI aspects of a design? Ignore all the details of what the events will actually do, and get the user interaction working, to do some nontrivial things? We are currently using as our textbook ""C# Programming"" by Doyle, and the Windows GUI section is chapters 9 and 10. The examples in chapter 9 had some poor practices (while loop inside a button click event handler?) which might be improved on, perhaps with the more detailed information in chapter 10, which covers input controls such as textboxes, radio buttons, checkboxes and listboxes.One example I created was of a simple method for students to ""clock in and out"" of the classroom sessions (as part of workplace readiness training). It looks bone-simple: a little box with their Windows Domain Name, two radio buttons for IN and OUT actions, and a few read-only textboxes that display accumulated time for the day and week. (It connects to a database on a server). I wanted the interface to behave ""a little strangely"":This takes some interesting code and unusual settings at design time, yet it creates an ideal interface to allow the desired functionality and nothing undesirable. It could not be simpler. What other examples of Windowing interface situations would make for concise, understandable and broadly applicable exercises?

That is some of them struggle to understand when you should use quotes and when not.For example, when trying to open a file, they will write open(/the/path/to/the/file) instead of open(""/the/path/to/the/file"") and fail to correct themselves. This is just an example ; the question is not about file/filename confusion.Conversely, some students, when asked to write a function a parameter of which is a string, will writeThere seem to be an underlying poor understanding of what a variable (or identifier) is. However these students are generally coping with programs that do not manipulate strings.A related question (maybe I should post this one separately) is about the pros and cons of introducing strings before arrays/lists or the converse.This takes place in France, in the CPGE (Classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles), a two-year curriculum that students may enroll in at the beginning of higher education (post-baccalauréat or post-A level or equivalent) but is physically located in high schools (lycées) and prepare students for national competitive exams (concours).As a result, the global content of the course is mandated nationwide (including the use of Python3 as an example language) ; I can only choose the order and the manner in which I teach things. The course is mandatory for students but is not the main field of the curriculum (I have 1hr/week of blackboard course and 1hr/week lab session, compared to 10 to 12 hr/week of math and 8 to 10 hr/week of physics).Computer science is not taught in France before university/higher education. There is only some algorithmics, taught by math teachers as well as they can, using pseudo-language and calculators languages, and not dealing with any data structure (only numbers) and no functions. So I start from zero.Even in CPGE, the idea of teaching CS as a field in itself is quite new and not universally accepted. As a result, the nationwide CS curriculum for CPGE mandates that problems and examples should be taken from math and physics situations, which leads to string being scarcely used except for file names and data input from files (csv).

In every edition we have problems with some students that have the idea that functional programming is useless, because the industry doesn't use it. The more nuanced students add that some functional programming techniques are useful in any language (they think of lambda expressions in Java, map in Python, etc.) but that there is no point in learning pure functional programming as you cannot use it to build real-world applications (and if you can, nobody does it). These students usually tend to infect others and that can bring an unpleasant atmosphere.I have read Hughes' 1990 paper Why Functional Programming Matters, where he explains that people in arguing for FP often tend to show what it doesn't have (assignment, side effects, ...) instead of what it does have. However, the things he mentions that FP does have (higher level of abstraction through gluing functions, lazy evaluation and thus easier modularity) are hard to grasp for mid-Bachelor students. In the end of the course they should be able to understand those advantages when you talk them through it, but the problem is motivating them from the start.I know that most students will not end up as a functional programmer. But, learning one language means getting more proficient in others, and analogously for paradigms, so I think it is still helpful for them to study it. Yet when I explain this to the students the inevitable question is ""why don't you teach us FP in a language that we can actually use later?"".What can I use to show the usefulness of functional programming?Note: like many universities we don't use Haskell in all courses but a lesser known more academical functional programming language.

367,3422,Course for the more practical aspects of software development,"By default, I approach every training I conduct ( I mostly conduct sessions for folks who are in their final year, or finished graduation but looking to upskill for a better career) with a simple underlying goal. If you learn xyz technology, will help you (eventually, if not right away) to make a little more money than what you do now. I have noticed that there are a lot of students (defined above) are pretty good in what they do (coding stuff). However, they lack certain essential skills that are really warranted in a work atmosphere. Taking my own example, at best, I am a below average developer at best, but somehow somewhere, I end up working in some high level projects. When I self analyse, I notice that my communication skills, presentation skills and simply the ability to discuss without fear with the key stakeholders (like the VPs, CTOs and CEOs) allows me get assignments that otherwise would not. So, over the years, I have made it a point to provide feedback about non-technical skills to my students. Now, after so many years of training, I want to take this to the next level. instead of just giving feedback, I want to make it part of my curriculum. There lies my challenge. In a session I conducted last year, I noticed that an entire team of developers were just straight up bad with their English. This may seem strange to other community members, but English, the preferred language of communication itself is a huge challenge for many of us folks here in India. When I finished my gentle tirade by concluding that the reason why all of them being billed lowered rates despite being technically competent (and I was one of the trainers who made that happen) is because you guys cannot speak and communicate in general. Eventually, despite maintaining excellent ratings for all the previous ratings, for the last day, I got 1 out of 10 ratings for every point in the review sheet. So, a very long story short, like the English example above, there are so many other qualities that are lacking in developers in general.

Right now, the only solution I have is, just give up on that. My pay is linked to my reviews. At the same time, I feel strongly about this.

368,3434,Best Practices for introductory teaching,"Literature states that there are particularly difficult issues with introducing programming, and that many of the issues are still not well understood. But some results indicate that these are some effective methods:These methods reduce cognitive load, so that the students can focus on the relevant ('germane') details while learning or demonstrating proficiency. Other details and distractions cause 'noise' which make the cognitive load too high. Another factor is that methods that work for beginners are inappropriate or hindering to more advanced students, and in a classroom with varying abilities it can become difficult to structure material or present it properly.Perhaps the biggest variation is in student's predispositions towards problems solving. This quote points to a major obstacle to most programming learning:A weakness of worked-out examples is that they may not engage the
  learner enough to induce germane load. The effectiveness of the
  examples is negated if the learner does not study them attentively and

Advice might be for developing hard skills or soft and both may be needed to be employable. Many entry level positions are not very challenging or rewarding, unfortunately. This may be the fault of the educational process itself, leaving graduates unprepared for better positions. I assume that no educational program can teach everything. Therefore some things are emphasized more than others and some necessary things may be omitted, especially in a changing world. I'm not making an indictment of the educational process, but wondering what important things the individual still needs to know, and what skills they need, beyond their formal education.

Is it worth mentioning that a headless git repository is no different than a local one, and that you can pull directly from a non-origin repo?

My main goal is to ensure that they can practically apply and test the things they learn with the other 2 researchers.The first session I gave was about building and configuring their own workplace  and just made sure the students correctly followed the manual I wrote. Yesterday I gave the second session (where the fun things should start). This is when i discovered that 70% of my students have no basic IT knowledge.They say: It's not our fault if the students don't have the necessary knowledge for understanding us, they should work harder at home. And we are busy with our research.This course will be divided into 3 parts: programming, system administration and networking.No mouse allowed, only keyboards.No User friendly OS allowed and of course no GUI. OpenBSD and VIM for everyone.I have 80 hours with this class. 4 (sometime 6) hours per week on 6 months. I'm intending to use ~35 hours for teaching basics. There is no way I will let my students cook security related operations without them understanding what they are doing.Is the IT basics course plan is good enough for understanding basic infosec ? (Should I add or remove topics, is 35 hours not enough or too much..)I'm very new into the infosec teaching field, not very sure I'm doing this right...I do not seek opinion based answers, but testimony of accomplished teachers who have watched their students grow from IT enthusiast into promising engineers.A class of 26 persons. All graduated a bachelor degree, not in the IT Field for most of them. All Japanese, so I teach in Japanese.Yes, they are motivated, well at least they are highly active in class. I don't know if the infosec field interests them or interacting with a non-Japanese teacher is somehow fun.They ask me tons of questions, all IT related. Those questions pointed out a general lack of IT engineering basics knowledge. For being sure I wrote a short test, and as expected the results were not good. (Recently teach them how to convert decimal to binary and hexadecimal without tools.)All researchers and Japanese. My students are somehow afraid to ask questions during other class lecture, looks like I'm their personal stack exchange website.I spoke with the other teachers, and I somehow understand my students.

Writing papers on subjects that don't matter anymore is what they like.Yes, they are all preparing a master degree in computer science. The majors differ though (Architecture, software, system administration, security...)From my opinion, The Japanese educational system is pretty odd.
I mean how come graduating a bachelor degree in economics or marketing can let you attend a master degree in computer science? The IT fundamental I will try to teach them is a knowledge any future engineer should acquire during a bachelor degree, not a master. At least in France.

Generally about 15% of the class are students that do work that deserve an A, and the rest is split fairly evenly between a C and an F (F's generally fall around 30% for these students). I appreciate your feedback and thoughts, hopefully with the help of this community I can help motivate these students to excel.Edit: Adding more to the 3rd bullet above.

However, they ignore the feedback and end up losing the same amount of points they did the previous week for the same problem.Edit2: Answering some comments here. This is in the United States and they are working in C# with Unity3D. The class has pre-requisites that do funnel nicely to the content, because they start with just learning the basics of C# then they learn more complicated computer science concepts in C# all while learning simple game design using gamemaker, which can essentially be a drag and drop tool.

I have decided on the goal for this session to be for the students to reflect on the role of interaction design and usability evaluations in a larger frame - for instance, what relations they have to database administration or to developers. I am hoping to motivate the students to see what their own future role could be, should they choose to go down that path, and otherwise to understand that it does play an important part along with the things that do interest them.My question is: Do you have suggestions for examples that I could provide them with, such as case studies of software development processes, or can you think of good arguments to put forth?Other comments are also very welcome!(I have always been interested in usability and user experience, so I would especially like answers from people who might feel less interested and therefore understand my future students better)Edit: I am not just looking for examples of good/bad end results but also of the design/development process, to showcase e.g. how interaction design relates to programming/development.",2017-09-25 10:20:47,3117,True,153,8,0,2,"['student-motivation', 'gui']",7,False

Students are often surprised when I explain that I last programmed professionally near the start of the millennium, and also that I have learned the language I am teaching only recently (C#, which did not exist way back when).I think that some students ask because they are trying to find a point of interest themselves, so that this can become something they desire to be, rather than just a job.

417,3734,Example for For vs While Loop (in Java),"I'm looking for a set of concrete examples that illustrates good use cases of using a for vs a while loop for beginners. I feel that I have a good grasp on teaching them about these loops in the abstract (e.g., definite vs indefinite loops, how we apply those concepts in life), but I would also like to show two (hopefully somewhat contextually related) motivating programming examples - one where a for loop is more appropriate, and one where a while loop is. Obviously either type of loop can be used in either instance, but I would like to prompt students to think more about when to use one versus the other. Coming up with two good examples that are illustrative of this point is eluding me.To further limit the options available, students only know about console I/O, String/int/double types/variables, conditionals, and while loops. We are using Java.So, for example, if I wasn't so focused on finding something that beginners could implement, I would show that a good use of a while loop is for a robot that should always be listening for voice input from a user; this is a good use, because we don't know when (i.e., after how many iterations) we will stop listening for voice input. I would then contrast this with a robot parsing through transcriptions of user voice input to identify keywords and respond to them. I've considered trying to translate this into console I/O, but the use of looping to continuously look for console input lends itself somewhat better to do-while loops, which we'll cover next.I realize my question is likely a rehash of what was asked here, but I wasn't happy with the answers. Answers on that post dealt more about the ordering of topics for teaching loops (e.g., while loops before for loops), or real-world motivating examples (e.g., while I'm not full, continue eating pizza).

420,3747,Teaching students that printf() is not the same as return,"For a few years, I have been teaching a programming class to first-year electrical engineering students -- thus, this is their first contact with computer programming. The language used is C (although this year I started using Logo for the first few weeks as it presents a smaller barrier to entry for a gentler introduction to the practice of programming).Although the students have issues with many topics of the course, many of them are with more complicated concepts such as recursions and data structures. However, one point that I feel should be easy, yet I'm somehow not getting across to them, is the importance of returning a value in a function.Concretely, say I want to calculate the norm of a two-dimensional vector, and break it down into the smallest possible functions. So rather than writing something like this:I might write something like this:Although my students have no problem understanding this breakdown of functions, if I left it for them to write the code, they would probably write something along the following lines, which obviously wouldn't work, and they would be unable to figure out why:Note: this isn't actual code that any of my students have written. This is just how I imagine they'd write it if I just sticked to their suggestions during the coding session.What kind of analogies, objections, examples, counterexamples or strategies could I try to get them to understand that, by printing from a function, the value is not ""routed"" to the rest of the program, and thus the remainder of the computation will have no access to it?I try to introduce the concept of a CS function by analogy with a mathematical function, say $f(x) = x^2$ (I understand there is the issue of side effects in a CS function, which don't exist in a mathematical function, but I do try to mention this point). I show them how a parameter is passed (in this case $x$) and an operation is performed on it. Passing a parameter is a concept that they grasp easily enough, however most of my students appear somehow unable to understand the seemingly symmetrical issue of returning a value from that function.Usually, by the point I start talking about functions, I have already introduced the printf() function and shown how it can print the value of variables to the screen. Then, whenever I propose a problem which uses a function and try to engage the class to help me write code for it, they always get stuck when it comes the point of returning the value from the function. They do understand the importance of getting the value out of the function, but they always suggest I do it using printf() rather than return. Clearly this introduces a problem for the program we are writing because although we can see the intermediate results, there is no (sensible) way to consume the output stream in the rest of the program.Although they do understand the importance of getting the computed value out of the function, they seem to think it's OK if it's just printed with printf() rather than properly returned from the function. I try to object that once something is printed to the screen, although it does show you, the programmer, the value in question, the computer can't ""read"" a printed value back from the screen gives that it's now just an assorted bunch of pixels on the screen.

These 3 parts should be Computer Science, IT, and Digital Literacy (that paper says that its meaning for IT, is not the same as others have used it).I have no problem understanding what Computer Science is and what it includes, however I continue to struggle with understanding what IT and Digital literacy are.“Digital literacy is not a ‘subject’ in itself – neither are reading and writing – but is an essential skill for all in the modern age.” … “‘Office’ applications such as word processing,” — So learning learning to use office applications at a high level, is it IT or Digital Literacy or both?I also think a lot of other teachers struggle with this. I have heard teachers saying “We don't do that any more. No we don't do ICT any more.” or “Isn't it a shame that we don't do that any more, now that there is no ICT.”. In a lot of instances I think that what they are talking about would be IT or Digital literacy, under the new scheme.There are other cases, where I see teachers planning to teach computer art, and wonder is this not art? (A lot of this could be leftover from the ICT days.)So the question is what is the difference between Computer Science, IT, and Digital Literacy? with examples.E.g.

The students must use the syntax provided (in something resembling an API) to generate commands that the Robot will ultimately use to create a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich.*I've also created a little engine that can run this all at the command prompt, and gives back useful errors if the students either generate a syntax error (ie. take rightHand plate instead of take plate rightHand) or attempts an illegal action (such as take plate rightHand when rightHand is already full).  I have not yet given them access to the engine; they spent the last 15 minutes of the previous period trying to generate a full set of working instructions from the specification, and they had a lot of fun doing it!I have a vague notion about what will come next; I want to integrate allowing them to copy/paste their instructions into the engine to see if they have run into trouble, and creating an actual PB&J sandwich (or whatever components of that sandwich they've actually managed to make.)

I would like to foster these skills, but I am at a loss. This is a class of complete programming novices. Most students have no prior experience. Some students have a little prior experience in some OOP language, but it is usually self-taught with little regard to breaking down larger problems.The first problem seems easy enough (encourage students to write a glossary of tools we learn with examples - we only require knowledge of a handful of methods), but students rarely do it. The second problem has been a white whale of mine for the past year and a half. I teach activity diagrams and model problem solving in class, but when I try to require activity diagrams as part of program submission, I mostly get students who solve the program first, then reverse engineer their diagram. I would love to require their diagrams to be submitted ahead of time for feedback, but I do not have the time to grade it before the program is due. I do have some students who show up to office hours and never pull out their computer - they just draw diagrams with me, and they are fantastic students. But, they are the minority.I fully believe these skills are just as important, and perhaps more important, than eventually writing that correct program, but the program of course is what they need to be able to do.

One of the aspects of this, of course, is to learn to accept feedback from the listeners and to evaluate it properly. In a class of novices this may also require some training of the listeners so that they offer constructive advice and not just negative comments. It may also require finding ways to quiet those who offer inappropriate feedback, but to also teach them better behavior.

No information about the relationships such as brother, nephew, grandparent and so on can or should be stored in this table.The application would pull in all of this data in to a tree structure, and based on who is selected as the focus person (""me"" in the tree), all of the relationship titles can be 'computed' and displayed. They are me-centric and so are not part of the data, only part of who is centered in the display.This example points out the many and very vivid differences between a data storage method and an Object-Oriented view of data:This shows the differences between data in a database and objects at run-time very clearly. I have not seen this example given anywhere else.

461,3948,"Teaching students how to construct regular expressions (and other ""translation"" style problems)","I'm currently helping teach a unit about languages as a part of a discrete math course -- we're currently focusing on regular expressions, NFAs, DFAs, CFGs, grammars, and the like. One of the skills we'd like students to be able to acquire is the ability to translate English into equivalent regular expressions -- e.g. translate phrases like ""match all strings containing an even number of the character 'a'"" or ""match all binary strings that do not contain the string '1001'"".Some students seem to easily pick up the ""knack"" of performing these sorts of translations, but many more of them seem to struggle.Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to best help these students. Constructing regular expressions isn't usually something I find particularly difficult, so I've been finding it difficult to ""get into the mindset"" of the students who find writing regular expressions to be less obvious. I've spent some time introspecting and trying to pick apart what strategies I subconsciously tend to use when faced with a new problem, but that's mostly yielded a list of ad-hoc strategies rather then anything fundamental.Something I feel I should note is that I don't think unfamiliarity with syntax is likely to be the culprit. We're starting by studying specifically regular expressions (not regex) and have restricted ourselves to using a very minimal toolset: union, concatenation, the Kleene star, and epsilons -- so, no backreferences, no captures, nothing like that. Rather, it seems what students find most difficult is the inherent act of interpreting and translating an English sentence and formalizing it into some logical form.I've seen this same sort difficulty of manifest appear in other scenarios: for example, earlier this quarter, we asked students to translate English into propositional or predicate logic: I also found it difficult to teach students how to do this in any kind of systematic way. As another example, in other courses, I've observed many students find it challenging to translate English into SQL queries (and here I have some more sympathy, since I also find constructing certain kinds of SQL queries to be challenging).The best I've been able to do so far is just have students do a bunch of practice/walk through a bunch of examples, but that doesn't strike me as being a particularly efficient strategy (though I don't dispute that practice is essential).This brings me to the core of my question: How can I more effectively help students master the meta-skill of ""translation""/""formalization""? I'd welcome both answers focusing on strategies for helping students more effectively construct regular expressions as well as answers focusing on helping students acquire this meta-skill in a more general sense. Answers that can give me more nuanced insight what sorts of things students find difficult about these types of problems would also be welcome.Note: somebody asked a similar question to this one about helping students who are familiar with Java learn regex. However, that question seems to focus more on how to best teach the nuts and bolts of regex-the-language; my question is more about how to teach the meta-skill of ""translation/formalization"".",2017-11-09 06:02:12,732,True,155,10,3,2,"['lesson-ideas', 'regex', 'discrete-math']",3,False

Main storage, as seen by a process or task, appears as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments. The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a memory management unit or MMU, automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Software within the operating system may extend these capabilities to provide a virtual address space that can exceed the capacity of real memory and thus reference more memory than is physically present in the computer.While in other resources they use the phrase “virtual memory”, and describe “paging”. Virtual memory is a section of volatile memory created temporarily on
  the storage drive. It is created when a computer is running many
  processes at once and RAM is running low.The operating system makes part of the storage drive available to use
  as RAM. Virtual memory is much slower than main memory because
  processing power is being taken up by moving data around, rather than
  just executing instructions. The guide on operating systems explains
  how the OS manages memory.Taken from https://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zmb9mp3/revision/8 Though I have seen the same in resources approved by the exam board.So the question is what do I do in these situations?Context:UK England, GCSE / A-Level",2017-11-14 19:44:54,204,True,95,3,0,2,['exams'],0,False

I have been thinking about the best way to structure such a course, and am starting to believe that an agile approach might have merit.The idea is:The students are seniors or juniors and one deliverable for the course is that, by the end, they have written a mobile application that makes use of web services, location services, graphical information display, and a mobile database.Also, the students should be able to use version control, do an appropriate amount of software and UI/UX design, perform reviews of others' code, incorporate automated and manual testing into their projects.Because they are nearing the end of their studies, I believe showing them how a ""real world"" agile project might work in the scope of what they currently do (studying) would be a good secondary goal.My questions are:So it looks like, based on the school calendar, that we'll have enough time for an introductory session, four three-week sprints, a final demo session and two floating sessions available or other work.So there are two approaches to this:Assume the ""product"" is student knowledge about mobile application development and have each student select items from the generic backlog to work on each sprint.Assume the ""product"" is a mobile app that must meet certain criteria in terms of functionality and have each student define their app, which will then produce user stories.This can be seen as subvert[ing] the very purpose and essence of agile development, as Buffy noted.If done properly, this might not be the case: the aim is to fill in each student's knowledge gaps.  That will need to be highly adaptive per student and, probably, per topic area.If I'm the product owner then I get to say whether they've met the acceptance criteria --- they know enough about the topic of the user story.If, instead, we get another student to be the product owner (or perhaps ""QA"" with delegation from me as PO), then the idea of pairing can be brought in as the student will have to come to some mutual understanding of the ""definition of done"".Acceptance CriteriaExamples of User StoriesIf the product is the mobile application, then this simplifies things and makes the agile approach closer to what a software engineer would have to follow in a real work environment.Here, if I'm the product owner, then I'll need to understand all the possible apps (if the students get to choose their own app idea).Again, it might be better for that to be delegated to another student or group of students.Acceptance CriteriaExamples of User Stories",2017-11-29 16:17:33,1660,True,386,8,1,3,"['curriculum-design', 'resource-request']",7,False

In my experience, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, I've found that teaching my students that ""mod is the remainder of division"" is insufficient if I want them to make any use of the concept later on.Beyond showing them how to use mod to check divisibility, I have for the last few years gone into far more interesting operations in order to help them achieve some intuitive understanding of what mod is and how it works.  So, for instance, I show them how they can increment within a modular circle of numbers from 0 to n-1 (a circle of size n):Or, how to move that circle along so that it ranges from m to (m+n-1) (still a circle of size n, but it no longer starts at 0):Or how to decrement along a 0 to n-1 circle in a language like Java, which deals with negative modular operations by returning the highest negative congruence (ie. -10 % 4 would return -2 instead of 2.  While they are both technically correct answers, Java's answer is decidedly inconvenient for the purpose of moving along a modular circle of numbers, because when you try to move from 0 back to n-1, you get the wrong result.)Or, doing the same thing by moving n-1 steps clockwise around the circle instead of moving 1 step counterclockwise:And, of course, we can generalize this to involve any cyclical pattern of numbers that can be reduced to a proper modular circle where $f(n)$ is the function that takes any number within the cycle to its corresponding location in the modular circle, and $g(n)$ is the function that takes it back:Now, I am reasonable certain that nobody uses structures like this in any production environment.  Part of my justification for going to such lengths with mod operators has been that I am not a teacher of software engineering.  I am a teacher of computer science, and having a firm understanding of modular arithmetic is important for Some Big Ideas later on.  (Like Two's Complement, which has a very intuitive and coherent explanation when you think about it in terms of cycles within a number space.)  And when all is said and done, many of my students really do come out with a good, intuitive sense of how the mod operation works.But I also wonder if I have just gone plum crazy.

527,4282,When does excessive collaboration become plagiarism?,"I was reading the abstract for this research paper: Yan, L., McKeown, N., Piech, C.: Using programming assignment work patterns to understand excessive collaboration in large CS classes, in SIGCSE 2018, Baltimore, USA, 2018As computer science classes grow, instructor workload also increases:
  teachers must simultaneously teach material, provide assignment
  feedback, and monitor student progress. At scale, it is hard to know
  which students need extra help, and some students can resort to
  excessive collaboration, using online resources or relying heavily on
  peer code, to complete their assignment. In this paper, we present
  TMOSS, a tool that analyzes the intermediate steps a student takes to
  complete a programming assignment. We find that students who exhibit
  excessive collaboration typically deviate from the standard work
  pattern, use fewer class tutoring resources than their peers, and
  perform worse on assessments. Our goal is to identify students at-risk
  of plagiarizing, so we can intervene and provide additional class
  resources to help them succeed.So, my question is: where should the line between excessive collaboration and plagiarism be drawn?",2018-01-30 11:47:38,1144,True,"3,655",14,2,4,"['plagiarism', 'collaboration']",7,False

So, to avoid a future failure of #2, and intense boredom from lack of #1 throughout schooling, how can I encourage interest and motivation?To explain why this is so important, I quote from the Computing Ed Research Blog (emphasis in original):If the only educated people in our society were the ones who wanted to learn (at the start, from the beginning of a class), our society would collapse. We would have too few educated workers to create innovations and maintain the technology we have. Our society depends on teachers who motivate students to persevere and learn.I have long puzzled over what I see around me: that many people think of their job as just providing a paycheck. I could not survive that way, work has to be interesting also. But now I see that this is not just my problem, it is a problem for society, because unmotivated people will not be creating any new ways to improve our lives and keep the economy going. Apparently the tendency will be for more and more work to be automated, surprisingly not at the grunt level but at the white-collar level. So, we can either get forced out of creative, interesting work by automation, or we can outrun it, creating new opportunities.How can I motivate students to ""persevere and learn""?

I worry that using + for inclusive disjunction will confuse students, and I know that implicit multiplication, i.e. AB for A∧B is confusing.I hesitate to use the notation of programming because it seems Java and Python are equally popular, but with very different notations.  Java's use of ^ for exclusive disjunction further muddles things.Does anyone know of research or have practical advice on what notation I should use to teach these concepts?Edit: OK, I've accepted an answer, and decided to use the engineering notation, but to present a table comparing notations near the end of the module.

with
$$v(t_{n+1})\approx v(t_n)+g*(t_{n+1}-t_n)$$and then run over times $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and see that the $y$ values they get are the same as:$$y(t_n)\approx y(t_1)+v(t_1)\,t_n+\frac{1}{2}g\,t_n^2$$However, because they use float, they get rounding errors when dealing with small time differences ($\Delta t$). I don't want to get into the whole floating point arithmetics field, because they won't understand that (the word ""exponent"" would frighten them, to say the least). On the other hand, if they use double, then the rounding errors wouldn't be significant (because they aren't dealing with $\Delta t \le 10^{-5}$ of a second).

In the middle school where I am teaching, my predecessor assembled the VEX kits into  ""squareBots,"" a design suggested by VEX and RobotC. The robot is equipped with two motors driving left and right sides of an eight-inch square chassis, equipped with a set of sensors.

543,4364,The Fifth Element or What Elements Are Correlated With CS Success and Does It Matter? [closed],"
Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.
                Closed 3 years ago.After a long search a colleague says that the only 'predictor' of computing ability seems to be Autism, and that only with a low correlation (60%, whatever that means). But in our experience of teaching students with various disabilities, including mild forms of Asperger's, we find that even this is all over the map: One student was an amazing programmer but could not finish assignments because the temptation to always add more was so high, another could not see past tiny details that became fixations. Another could not generalize past results to new slightly different situations. Another could easily do the work, but was bored and uninterested.So it seems that this element Au is not the gold that it would seem to be, yet no other elements have turned up to predict success.My observations over 4 decades have been that many people can learn to do tasks involving computers which amount to configuration or customization within a limited domain, but that conceiving of algorithms or new data types is not going to come to them easily. (And if work or school is far too hard, one will not be successful.) In fact, a lot of my early programming career was devoted to converting tasks from programming to customization, just so that we could free up our programmers to do the complex stuff. What causes or indicates this difference in people - some easily learn programming, others not? Is there another element at stake, like Intelligence? But there is no definition or agreement on that either...I am thinking that 'real' programming ability is a ""rare earth"", and not something widely found, yet the modern world seems to require increasing numbers of this material (so many jobs going unfilled, projects failing, etc.) If we cannot dig it up, or transmute it from other material (schooling) or find a substitute, then what can be done?

I intend to emphasize that most of the code is already written. E.g. the code for creating nice graphs exists in charts-js, and responsive client side frameworks (angular, react) exist. This project is also meant to teach the notion that programmers rarely write programs from scratch, and that they should often see if there exists a library\framework that give a functionality they need. However, with Javascript, the vast number of libraries makes it somewhat difficult to know which ones to pick. It's not impossible, but I'd rather students not waste time on that. I ran this by a handful of students, to see whether students actually get overwhelmed. From what I saw, students are likely to waste time reading up about the library they are checking (somewhat like reading a review for a PC before buying it). Research is great, but the amount of wasted time was quite big. So, what can I do to teach them how to ""sniff"" the ""correct"" library more efficiently? In other words, how can I teach them which metrics are significant (and why those metrics are important) when deciding whether a library is useful?

At the other end, teachers are often called upon to teach something like APCS-A when they don't themselves even know Java and have little, if any, experience in Object-Oriented Programming. How can they proceed and be effective. I don't think that ""Keeping one day ahead of the students"" is any sort of answer to this and will likely leave the students frustrated and confused. If you are in this situation, I assume that the obvious solution (DON'T) isn't available to you. Similarly ""Fake it 'til you make it"" isn't a solution since the future of your students is at risk. It is possible, of course, to borrow a syllabus and book list from some other teacher, but the deeper issue is about how you respond to student questions and concerns when your own knowledge doesn't provide an answer.

  repetition doesn't matter.Then going with examples of what is a set and what is not. But over time I found that people tend towards analogies, more than formal. I have no issue with analogies and I also do it. But they tend to forget the basic definition and facing problems while doing mathematical analysis.Colleagues suggest that students can find formal definitions through textbooks and hence reduce burden of teaching too formally by referring corresponding textbooks and focus on motivation and surface teaching only. But I am not at all satisfied by it because in CS, things only work by formal definitions, not (only) by analogy.What should I do? Continuing or discontinuing on stress formalising?

Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.
                Closed 3 years ago.According to research, if people are to develop abstract reasoning capabilities (Formal Operations and Post-Formal) they need the proper exposure at age 7 to 12 - generally speaking. Adults that were not exposed properly at the right time do not progress past Concrete Operations well, or at all. Thus, it is difficult or impossible for them to become programmers later on, or to go in to other fields requiring abstract reasoning capability.If we accept that this is true, then we must provide the correct training at age 7 to 12 and beyond, if we want to have people who are capable of performing in these sorts of ways, because later on is too late for them to acquire those capabilities. We can't wait for them to reach the age of majority and then say, ""I want to become a programmer"", because if they didn't have the right sort of background preparation, they cannot. We have deprived them of the ability to make that choice for themselves.But, if we push the students in to this sort of schooling before they can decide for themselves, then they also are not acting with free will in that case either.The first case prevents them from choosing something, the second allows them to choose it, but only because we made other choices for them. Studying one thing tends to mean not studying other things, as there are only 24 hours in a day. Successful Gymnasts and Musicians usually start as soon as they can walk, or reach the instrument. Successful programmers will need some exposure to thought processes that they need, early on.How can we balance the objectives of allowing people choice, enabling them to choose by preparing them properly, providing the economy with prepared workers and supporting values like freedom of choice? It seems to me that some decisions are forced, and the timing of education is one of them. We get to choose, but we don't get to choose the choices we are presented with. So we have to make wise choices on behalf of (lots of) others, often without being able to obtain their consent, perhaps because they are too young to give it.",2018-03-13 19:20:58,4622,True,197,2,1,2,['curriculum-design'],10,False

568,4513,What are the advantages and disadvantages of cumulative vs percentage grading?,"There are many ways to grade students. One is to provide a fixed body of student work and then give a percentage grade for assignments, with the overall grade representing the percentage achieved of some ideal. 90% = A, etc. The student is expected to work on each assignment. This is Grading by Percentages.Another way (Grading by Points, Cumulative Grading) is to provide a body of assignments with a point total assigned to each part, preferably with small granularity but totaling, say 1000 points. The grading is done cumulatively with, say, 900 or more points required for an A grade. The instructor evaluates each assignment and gives points based on quality, etc. perhaps giving 40 points on an assignment that is ""worth"" 50. Here the student can work until they have enough points to achieve a grade that is acceptable to them. After that, they no longer need to do anything and can focus on other courses or commitments. It is, of course, good to warn students who are intending to go on that learning is still required to meet their greater goals and not to be too complacent.In either case, the instructor may permit re-work on assignments. If Grading by Points the rework earns additional points, but perhaps not up to the full marks for the work, but some positive increment.The writer used Grading by Points in the latter part of his career. What advantages and disadvantages are there of each scheme. What improvements can you make to either or both of these?For clarity, the real difference is that in Cumulative Grading, the rubric tells the student how many points are needed for each grade and they can choose to get them any way that they like, spread over the assignments, whose totals are also known. In percentage grading, especially with different things worth different ""weights"" it is (a bit) harder for the student to know where they are likely to wind up. They know their ""average"" perhaps, but every assignment affects the average. Therefore with Cumulative Grading, the student always increases their points, where with percentage grading, each assignment can get you closer or farther away from your goal.

The counter is that the curriculum is not designed to teach specialist skills, insisting that there is a core subset of programming concepts that every educated person should understand.The official guidance does not make it clear which programming concepts should be taught, instead offering vague recommendations. This is about as good as it gets:use 2 or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures [for example, lists, tables or arrays]; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functionsunderstand simple Boolean logic [for example, AND, OR and NOT] and some of its uses in circuits and programming; understand how numbers can be represented in binary, and be able to carry out simple operations on binary numbers [for example, binary addition, and conversion between binary and decimal]I understand this is not the place for a debate or discussion, so would like to ask if anyone could define what general purpose programming skills are, with any clarity?",2018-04-12 01:15:56,4898,True,314,6,1,4,['high-school'],5,False

588,4626,How can I speed up the construction of high quality testing materials?,"Giving the same assessments from year to year causes fairly obvious problems.  Cheating becomes more and more of a potential issue.  Basic testing security dictates that we must create new assessments.However, generating new material has a few problems of its own:It is not unusual for the creation of a single test or quiz to take me 3-4 hours to design.  I have to look over the curricular material and brainstorm problems that can get to the heart of the core issues.  I then have to design the problems, test everything in an IDE (to make sure that there are, at least, no typos in the code examples), create grading rubrics and processes, and finish up with final formatting.I tend to use a mix of multiple choice, free-response (coding by hand), and short answer questions  The first and second of these are what students will find on the AP Computer Science A test, so I need to give students practice with these kinds of activities.  The short answer questions are an easy way to check for understanding of some particular little point.I have found that, between my various classes, I give an average of one quiz or test per week.  If we assumed a 40 hour work-week (ha!), then designing each assessment fresh would be a commitment of 7.5%-10% of my entire work time.  That doesn't count the time to administer or grade the thing, this is just for the design aspect.In reality, then, I mostly don't do this, and mostly give assessments from prior years.  I want to change this practice, but I don't see how I realistically can.Are there strategies to speed up the design of written assessments without losing quality?  Note: I don't want to give fewer assessments, because labs are suspect, and because of the tremendous cognitive benefits of testing.  Instead, I would ideally like to be able to design a high-quality test or quiz in under an hour.  This amount of time would make the entire enterprise more tenable.For the benefit of future visitors, I will also include my own answer, though given my times, it will (obviously) only be a partial answer.",2018-04-16 17:06:56,27,True,"2,116",15,2,5,['assessment'],4,False

This review from one publisher raises some serious questions about the inclusion of the three exemplar labs. In particular, their conclusion states the following:In our opinion, one or two activities from Magpie and Picture Lab
  might fit into a typical AP CS A syllabus. Elevens is best left for a
  team project after the exam (unless the Development Committee decides
  to make it a new case study). Implementing the labs in their entirety

This is also crucial because all AP courses I've ever taken or taught have required applications due to both the rigorous nature of the course and the need to whittle down an applicant pool that is larger than the number of available spots in the course.I have a couple theories of my own based on a few years of admitting students using several factors, but I will wait to self-answer until others share their practices.Note:Good answers need to include not only what the criteria used is, but also evidence - either in research or local practice - that supports the correlation between the chosen criteria and the eventual success, or lack thereof, of the students in AP CS courses (or, at a minimum reasonably advanced high school level CS courses).",2018-04-27 16:54:57,76,True,172,4,1,2,"['ap-computer-science-a', 'ap-cs-principles']",0,False

In our early, impressionable time together, I stress to these students (high-schoolers) and show them by example (I write lots of code for them) the importance of writing clear, readable code, which is partly achieved by explicitly specifying types for all variables (at first I do not tell them there are other options)However, at some point, I have to reveal to my students that they can, indeed, declare a variable as an Object (i.e. Object x = new Horse(""Silver"");) and that it can hold anything; or, that they can declare a variable as var (i.e. var y = ""foo"";) and that the compiler will figure out what type it is. Some of them discover this on their own, of course.Then I inevitably have students who abandon the good habits they had formed and want to make everything an Object, or declare everything as var (note I realize this is not equivalent in the language, but students tend to abuse the usage in the same way). I am always torn about how insistent to be that they revert, because I know the use of var in C# is controversial in the industry. (See the SO discussion use of var in C# for an example). Plus, the more savvy students are hanging out in SO anyway, and they see some questions and answers that lack explicit typing and other good programming habits.My question is, since these students are still learning, and since it is my classroom after all, should I emphatically require that they always explicitly specify types unless absolutely necessary?

When building enterprise-scale systems, avoiding things like state mutation becomes critical.  So why aren't functional languages taught first, and functional programming techniques taught as a ""use this approach first, when possible"" with imperative techniques and things like explicit memory management and use of mutable state taught as ""only use this when absolutely necessary for performance reasons""?I would think, with the increasing move towards multi-core processors, and the growing relevance of distributed systems, that teaching functional programming from the beginning would be the best way to prepare students for successful careers in the industry.

                Closed 3 years ago.One question that children are often asked is, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" This really means, what employment they would like. This question needs an answer, definitely by the time one must look for work, so at the end of college, or high school, or when one stops high school and starts working, as some 16 year-olds do in the US.But to have the answer at those points, one must have been working on it before then, to get the necessary experiences and schooling. So at what age should a kid be able to give a firm answer as to their chosen employment goal? Of course we are all expected to have several 'careers' in our long lifetimes now, so the answer does not need to be set and unchangeable, but it has to be there in time to get the ball rolling. As the old joke goes, ""Until you make up your mind, you can't change it."" I have heard of many people idling around in college with no path forward. This is a disaster.

621,4821,How can we best inform potential students of the nature of CS?,"Recent questions deal with the problem of too many applicants to CS programs, both in High School and University. Yes, this is a problem when only a smaller number can be accommodated for reasons of resource availability. One of the easier issues to deal with is whether the student's past performance indicates potential success, though even this is hard. If the student hasn't studied Computer Science in the past, what courses are predictors? But this question is focused elsewhere. Some students, in periods of high demand, choose a field simply because of its popularity at the time. While they may have the aptitude and background for it, their interest may be shallow or even misinformed. It would be good to help such students make better choices about their futures by informing them early of the nature of the field and how their future would likely play out if they stay in the field. The goal is to reduce the number of drop-outs: students who start a program, but leave it before completion. This potentially wastes both the student's time and resources as well as wasting institutional resources. It also risks denying other students an entrance slot that they might have had. In particular, such students may not know all of the things that CS professionals do on a daily basis. What are the interesting things? What are the boring things? What are the risks? What are the rewards? What frustrations? What will they ultimately need to do to become successful, in either the commercial or academic worlds. What resources can be brought to bear to assure that, possibly naive, students get a good look at the profession so as to better decide whether they want to enter?Google provides a lot of information for ""What is Computer Science?"" This includes the summaries given by a lot of colleges. However, most of it stresses only the positive things and so gives a somewhat incomplete picture.In the early 1960's as a teenager, I visited a local computer center. They had what was likely an IBM 650 with drum memory. I got to see what folks did back then and recall that I wasn't very impressed. I studied math. But CS wasn't an option then. But something more was needed in my case to generate interest.  For the record, I'm interested in drawing an accurate picture of work in the field, not horror stories or overly optimistic projections.

It seems that the keyword 'void' is only used to indicate an expression without a return value.

I want to know what are the methods for teaching programing?I'll provide a parallel example to make this clearer in case this causes any confusion.I have Portuguese as a native language and I teach English here in my country (therefore I'm an English teacher).In English teaching there are 3 main methods (over simplified below) of teaching used here.Method: Communicative Approach. Author: Noah Chomsky et al. -> Where you expose the student to a simple exercise and words and how to use them and then explains what happened and follow to more advanced exercises based on what is contained in the lesson (or to what you just explained). {It can be done starting with the mother language and then moving to the language one desires to learn as you progress in the classes, or classes can be taught entirely in
  the second language with a special care with the words used for beginners.}Method: NLP (Neuro Linguistics Programmming). Author: Various -> You expose the student to a simple set of words translated, for instance verbs, and asks  them to translate from their mother language to the language they are learning. Moving on to vocabulary and so on. On each lesson stacking how to use the verbs, vocabulary, expressions and some grammar (usually in this order).Method: Immersion. Author: Krassner et al -> The student is taught, much like Communicative Approach but classes are done fully in the language and in a place where the person lives a routine with the language. To learn English (or any other language as a matter of fact) like this, according to the method, one would have to live in an English speaking country.=========================================================================
Edit:
I believe this line is causing a bit of a confusionI did not meant that Learning a human language is the same as learning a programming language. I'm just saying that, in English language teaching we have methods to do that, as listed above. Does CS have one (or many)?Continuation of the original text:-> Part I believe is causing confusion:I think from here things were well understood.

In reality it stands for “other users”. So chmod o+w file really adds the writing permission (+w) for other users (who are not the owner or a member of the owning group). It doesn't help that what really refers to the “owner”, namely u (= owning user), makes it possible for one confusion to give rise to another: u is then confused for “‘normal’ users”: anybody not the owner or in the owning group.Sure, it helps to make people directly aware of this, but even if they can remind themselves that there's some trap here, the idea o = “owner”, u = “normal users” is so seductive, that they retain some insecurity until enough (sometimes a lot is necessary) rote memorization makes it finally sink in.What would be a mnemonic or other way to explain it which makes the correct notion stick right from the start, so rote memorization isn't necessary?PS: I'm not formally teaching anyone, it's just what I want to tell coworkers/friends. When I took a university course on Linux I first came across this confusion. There's a lot more about the Unix permission system which is very counter-intuitive, but those are issues arising necessarily from technical aspects.

636,4875,Courage to Attack Difficult Questions,"In a recent blog post Eugene Wallingford says that when teaching:I frequently pose a problem for them to work on for a few minutes before we look at a solution, or several candidates, as a group. All too often some students look at the problem, think it's too difficult, and then just sit there waiting for me to show them the answer. This approach often results in them feeling two kinds of failure: they didn't solve the problem, and they don't even appreciate the solution when they see it.There is a double problem here, The first is that some students don't attempt to solve a difficult problem - giving up early. This leads to the second problem of not recognizing the beauty of the solution once they see it.Often the exercises we give students have a learning objective that is more important than the actual solution to the problem. Learning is to be valued over solutions in a teaching environment. But students don't always see that and can be led to think of themselves as failures even when they work hard toward a solution (Authenticity Bias). We need to find ways to avoid that outcome while we encourage hard thinking.The big idea here is that the effort to find a solution, even if it goes down an unprofitable path, will lead to learning. The practice of ""stretching your brain muscle"" is wort pursuing.One Pedagogical Pattern was originally named Kobayashi Maru after a training exercise that was central to a certain Star Trek episode. In this pattern, the idea is to give students an impossible task to give them practice in very hard problems, possibly requiring orthogonal thinking. (The pattern was later re-named to Mission Impossible). That isn't exactly the same issue here, where we are looking to encourage deep thinking on deep but solvable problems.This issue is not just about programming. It can be anything. For example a complex database design issue or a complex retrieval. Or in Compilers, some optimization issue that needs to run fast.

637,4883,How to structure a Predictive Keyboard project similar to GBoard,"Many are now familiar with GBoard, the Google / Android predictive Keyboard. I don't actually know how it works. Obviously it must gather usage data on the device where it is being used, but it probably also includes a database of general usage patterns, downloaded initially and perhaps updated periodically. (Well, that is how I would do it.) In this way, it would be like a spellcheck database that let the user add (and subtract: manger is not too good in a business context) words.I have long been brushing aside the obvious question of ""how does it do that?"", but this morning as I was texting, I suddenly recalled the article in [Scientific American* (long ago, can't find it on the web) about Markov Chains and a simple program called Mark V. Shaney that would learn and then output words in a sensible order. That is how it could work. It should be quite easy to store and compress such a simple database.The particular thing I am focusing on is how GBoard offers three word suggestions as I type, so that I can just pick words instead of typing the words in. The prediction is at the word level, not the letter level. What frustrates me is that it usually does not offer the proper tense for a word, making me type far more letters until the proper word shows up. For example: I want to type ""He has started on it"" and I type H and choose 'He' from the suggestions, then ha and pick 'has' then type sta and the suggestions are: start starts starting, none of which agree with has. Why doesn't it go right to started?Has anyone implemented a similar project for analyzing and predicting or even uttering strings of words? It seems dead easy using Markov Chains. Do you think this would make a good project for using things like a 'dictionary' data structure to store words, and some kind of tree to encode the word association weights?

649,4932,Are programming contests beneficial to students?,"Background: I’m not entirely a CS educator, but I did run into a debate on whether programming contests are good for students.A lot of people around me have fun in programming contests. Usually, those contests require participants to “solve” several problems (like 7 to 8) within certain time (2 to 3 hours). Students are ranked by their scores, calculated from the number of problems they are capable of solving, and then the time spent. There are test cases on the submission system to which students have to submit their source files, and the submission “passes” when it compiles to a program which passes all the test cases.Given all these, while students are (probably?) good at problem solving skills, there are several problems:Students focus too much on the time spent on writing their programs. Therefore, they employ a lot of poor practices. For example, they always use short variable names, universal headers (#include ), using namespace std; etc in order to speed up their typing. They claim that iostream is implemented on top of C’s stdio and so they use printf even in C++.They always put extra assumptions. For example, while they know how to find the “unpaired” integer in an integer array (by taking the XOR sum), they won’t think of how to check whether the array has only one unpaired item. Also, they usually allocate large arrays in advance and skip bounds checking (they believe the array is large enough), which create concerns in both program stability and security.They don’t understand how to maintain a large project. Since OOP (usually) requires them to type more, they, for example, manipulate raw arrays with a part of custom heapsort algorithm, instead of creating a struct representing a heap, when they are writing in C. While sometimes OOP is unnecessary, for them code reuse is either impossible or requiring a lot of copy-and-paste.",2018-07-10 03:38:29,5491,True,361,11,1,4,"['best-practice', 'project']",1,False

This is part of a program called STEM professionals in schools. All I am there to do really is help kids see themselves as potential scientists or mathematicians, and to see the subject as fun and interesting (with kids this young, just being a visitor in the classroom is already fun and interesting). I bring along a set of little cards I made up of my (very diverse in background) colleagues and talk about them in an introduction lesson.These are my Computer Science lesson ideas:Word unscrambling. This is already a familiar exercise from homework. Each child gets a worksheet with a words 3-12 characters long to quickly unscramble.  We talk about why it was easy to unscramble 3-letter words and hard to unscramble 12-letter words. Then get ideas from the kids about instructions to solve the problem without knowing what the word is.  [Algorithms, algorithmic complexity, optimisation tricks that work for computers and people alike (common letter sequences like '-ion').]  This one is pretty well worked out, but happy to hear of anything I can do to make it cooler.Substitution coding. Starts out as how to pass a secret message like a spy. My aim is to end up with something like a compiler or maybe zipf encoding - substitution rules that make the encoded message denser than the final form. Here, I'm a bit stuck for a solid example. Maybe a cipher system with a limited vocab?  The principal concept is [substitution / naming / functions].Logo.  Basically a demo lesson using function definition in Logo to draw something recognizable (Captain America's shield, say), comparing how easy it is if I create my own substitution rules (functions).  Also demo recursion, substitution inside the substitution rule with the Koch snowflake, maybe some other fractals. This is a demo of Logo, concept is mainly [functions].Handwriting recognition deep learning.  Set up a recognizer (this is easy enough, right?) and give the kids a chance to test their own handwriting (this will be hardest on my son, I reckon).

However, they either seem unconvincing, or seem hard to explain to a new programmer who doesn't have much experience with computer science yet:Zero-based indexing lets you write loop conditions as i < n; with one-based indexing, we'd have to write i < n+1, which saves one instruction.  This makes no sense to me; i <= n seems like it would be fine.In C, we can use *a to access the first element of array a.  This doesn't seem very relevant today for a new student who isn't programming in C.With zero-based indexing, the expression a[i] compiles to an operation on memory address a + c*i where c is a constant representing the size of a single array element; with one-based indexing, it would need to compile to a + c*i - c.  This reason seems debatable today (couldn't a modern compiler often optimize this away?), but more importantly, I don't really want to be explaining memory addresses to a new programmer who doesn't understand memory layout and maybe doesn't even understand arrays yet.Is there a better way to explain why to a new student who is just getting started with computer science?",2018-09-03 00:54:03,1106,True,"37,059",186,84,29,['arrays'],3,False

When studying, say, the use of higher-order functions such as foldr, many materials contain a good set of exercises, starting from simple ones and proceeding to varying levels of challenge. When it comes to the ""higher abstractions,"" the situation is, in my humble opinion, extremely poor, even after combing through many sources and trying to extract everything that is available.To help the student understand and appreciate these abstractions I would expect to see highly varying, small to medium-sized exercises. These exercises should make the student, among other things,As background information, my two favourite materials are Hutton's Programming in Haskell (2nd ed.) for a solid basis and Allen's and Moronuki's Haskell Programming from First Principles for some of their material on more advanced topics.While Hutton's Programming in Haskell is a superb text for the basics, a good example of what is missing is its chapter ""Foldables and friends"" on monoids, foldables and transversables. The exercise set does not contain a single exercise that would make the student practice the use of these abstractions. It does not contain a single exercise of identifying the existence of these abstractions in some domain.These abstractions are, in my opinion, an order of magnitude more difficult to assimilate than, say, higher-order functions. There is also at least an order of magnitude difference in the number of exercises available, but it is in the wrong direction.Granted, Haskell Programming from First Principles does make you write a lot of instances of these abstractions in classic cases. Unfortunately it missed the other parts, and made me feel a bit like having proved a bunch of lemmas with very little idea of where those lemmas might be useful.I think this is relevant for the Haskell community in general.

If they all write their story at the same time then one person might start writing over part of a story already written by someone else.However I think that this analogy was probably not the best because he then asked me which person did “won”. I explained to him that nobody did win because the end result was that the “story” that was written on the blackboard was not making any sense. He then asked me how did I solved the problem and I told him that I did give each story writer his own blackboard.So I am looking for a good way to explain what is a race condition to a five years old, ideally without using a programming terminology because that would mean nothing to him.",2018-10-04 17:37:24,6019,True,312,8,0,6,['lesson-ideas'],1,False

698,5122,First project in my second year data structures intro,"I am currently teaching the pretty much normal second year Data Structures and Algorithms course. In this course there are four programming projects, with the first project completed the automated testing and grading yesterday. However, out of the 200+ students taking the course, only 72 managed to complete this project so that they passed my automated tester for the pseudorandom seed that I used. As my first question to this forum, I would like to get some second and third opinions about this issue before I decide how deep I dig my heels into the ground about it.This project (full specification) asked them to create a Java class named IntervalUnion whose objects represent unions of integer intervals, such as [1-5,9-12] or [4-8,11-15], with an arbitrary number of individual intervals allowed inside each such object. This class should then have the public methods union and intersection to create new objects, with the union of these two objects being [1-15] and intersection being [4-5,11-12], along with toString, equals and hashCode as usual.I simply cannot believe that this project would have been unreasonably difficult for second year computer science majors who have already taken the standard two first year courses of introduction to programming and computer science using Java. And yet for some reason it seemed to be, especially using my automated tester that, based on the given pseudorandom seed, generates random test cases and computes a checksum of the results returned by the implemented methods, this checksum then being expected to be equal to the checksum produced from my private model solution.For a test run that generated one million objects, easily automated with a Bash shell script, the passing projects took between one and three seconds to finish, whereas some solutions had to be terminated after minutes of waiting and thus rejected. The project spec specified a thirty second time limit that I would have assumed to be more than enough for them even to dilly dally.Of course I might be completely mistaken in my view about this, so I would like to hear some opinions of other teachers who have taught this same second year intro to algorithms, before I make any announcements to the students.Since my course uses the three best projects out of four in determining the total course grade, I am currently of the opinion that I am going to just tell the students to wake the hell up, realize that this is serious, and do better in the three remaining projects. The second programming project consists of writing method to remove all nodes with given key from the given linked list, and to sort the given linked list, using the sorting algorithm of their choice. (As with all these projects, the grading is 5 points for passing the automated tester, and 5 points for comparative running time rankings among all submissions.) There is just no way that that task could be considered too hard for second year CS majors.The last two programming projects (""Packing words in bins"" and ""Word filling"") due at the end of the course should be easy to at least pass in that within the simple rules of both word search puzzles, there are really no wrong answers, but the difficulty of both projects is in quickly finding a good solution that scores well.(As an aside, I am actually pretty proud of that Word filling problem, as its idea came to me last summer during a nice mellow walk, and the solution sketch the next day during a ride home followed by about an hour to implement after dinner, and I wonder if I could be the inventor of such a simple but tricksy puzzle that I simply can't recall ever seeing anywhere before this. Another more interesting variation might be to maximize the scrabble score of the words, since that doesn't actually change the solution algorithm.)",2018-10-09 12:27:38,3908,True,"1,165",8,2,4,"['java', 'project', 'algorithms', 'data-structure']",10,False
699,5128,Mental Model of Type Conformance/Subtype Polymorphism,"I'm finding that my CS2 students really struggle with the notions of type conformance and subtype polymorphism in Java. Say we have the following:They then consider the following problems, with my commentary on common mistake(s) following each problem:Students look at this and think b cannot be stored in v, either due to the type difference, or maybe because Bicycle has a constructor with a different number of parameters than the Vehicle constructor, so of course b can't 'fit' inside v.Students commonly think that the ride method in Vehicle will be called. I understand why this mistake is made, but those who get this correct still struggle then with this next problem:Students now think this is also syntactically valid. Because subtype polymorphism ensures that the method call will use the object's implementation, rather than the variable's, they think that Java will somehow recognize that v is storing an object of type Bicycle, and thus honkHorn is available to be called. It never occurs to them that Vehicle doesn't even have this method, so of course it won't work.Anyway, they have had two quizzes and now an exam involving these concepts (despite seeing them in class contextualized in other learning material all semester, and theoretically a little at the end of last semester), and a significant number of students are still struggling with this. Any suggestions on how to convey all these concepts? My approach is usually to convey very clear models of how things look in memory, but that doesn't seem sufficient here.

700,5134,Project based on game 2048,"I'm thinking about an assignment based around the game 2048. This would be towards the end of a first programming course at the university level and assumes the students have been introduced to at least two dimensional arrays, loops, conditionals and methods. The purpose is to have the students practice these skills.I would represent the board as a two dimensional array of int.I would require a method (e.g. merge(int[] row)) which does the work on an individual row of the puzzle when the move is to slide left. The idea is to encapsulate the work of a slide in a single, testable method. This also emphasizes that a two dimensional array is an array of array, and that one can work on a single row at a time.What are your opinions on the following ideas:Should a single move in the game be implemented as (move(direction)) or as individual methods (up() down() left() right())?One idea for completing the game involves rotating the board by multiples of 90 degrees. Then a move can be implemented as a three step process:Another idea is to show them that move right can be implemented by the processRequire a method to produce a list of empty cells for use in picking the location of the next ""insertion"". This could be a list of int to demonstrate how a single index can map to a row/col using div and mod operations. Alternatively, it could be a list of pairs of row/column.The last wrinkle is to decide what to actually stored in each board location. The simple answer is just the value. However, an interesting variation might be to store the log2 of the value. By doing this, you get an index that can be used to select, for example, the background color of each square of the board. This changes the logic of merge(), so that
combining adjacent cells ups the value by 1, rather than adding two values together.Am I trying to put too many different concepts into this assignment?

She needed some help to have a better understanding of programming, and increase her grade in this field. Computer science is not the main subject of her degree which is based on maths and physics.I asked her if she wanted to emphasise on a difficult subject for her, or if I should start from scratch and explain programming as if it was totally new for her. She chose the second solution, so I started to explain her the base of programming, binary, variables, functions, conditional statements, loops. And now I emphasis on the most common data structure ever, the array.I teach her how to use an array, manipulate its element, etc...
As she had to use programming to solve problems of graph theory, physics measurements, and mathematical algorithms which use a lot of matrices and arrays, I spend about six hours to make her be more familiar with it. I simplified it to make her use one-dimensional arrays with a simple algorithm, and she just told me that she can’t understand how arrays will be of any use for her, for her everyday life. She aims to get job in the field of statistics.I explained to her, that she uses array everyday without thinking about it. For example when you log in a website, there’s somewhere an array (or an object) which stores your username, password, email, and compares it to what is stored in a database. But she didn’t feel very enthusiastic.So  I can understand that not everybody enjoys programming, and as I am not a statistician I can’t really tell her about how useful this can be for a statistician.What can I do to actually make her change her mind about programming or show her the use of it for a statistician ?EDIT:
I work as Web developper so I am not used to statistics. I can't think about useful example or exercise to show her the usage of arrays in statistics.EDIT:

706,5157,Exercise or example to reinforce idea of functions?,"I have a group of students with a very shaky understanding of functions and their purpose (encapsulation, reuse, modularization). The assignments I give them require them to write simple functions that return boolean T/F, an integer or a simple Python object (str, list, etc.), then have the caller use the returned value in a print statement. Their programs are written in Python and run from the Windows command line.
The problem is that from the command line, the programs work but if you look inside it's a mess. The functions ignore the parameters to reach into the main for global variables (misunderstand the idea of parameter passing), the input validity checking is done in the caller (defeating the idea of encapsulation, e.g is day of month valid for a given month), or the function prints the result without returning anything. The worst that I get is the function does all the work of the main and of the function, for example when asking for a simple function to add 1 to its argument, I get:...which of course is nonsense.Here's my question... Can I craft an exercise that calls a simple function like add1() that would give a dramatically wrong output, e.g. cause the screen to ""blow"" up if the function printed instead of returned, or stalled if it kept asking for input. I'm thinking of something that reads a large file of text or numbers.The students are at the community college level and are not programmers -- they are in electronics technology (and some are convinced that there is no software involved in electronics). I use Python but this is (mostly) language independent (I see the same shaky understanding with C++ functions in the Arduino world in another course).Thanks in advance

739,5302,Should programming assignments be graded based on results from unit tests or based on the similarity to the correct implementation?,"Imagine students in a course on algorithms & data structures, which are given homework assignments to implement things like trees, hash sets, sorting algorithms, etc.Due to the high number of students per semester and limited resources, grading is heavily assisted by automatic unit tests. The TAs will still scan through the code, but if all or most of the test cases fail and there is no simple fix in sight, students will get 0 points on an assignment.Unfortunately, this can happen very quickly. Consider implementing a balanced tree as an example. If students fail to correctly reference the nodes, insertion, removal and searching, - despite being implemented correctly if seen individually - will not work and can hardly be tested.As expected, some students do complain about their poor grade and argue that ""although they acknowledge that their data structure does not work entirely, they at least implemented various sub-tasks correctly"". This may even be correct, but the TAs very often do not have the time to dig deep in the code and grade the internal functions of the students implementation. Especially for more complex data structures, it would also take too much time to fully comprehend and even debug the (erroneous) implementations.My question is, if it is okay to grade programming assignments based on this external view (does the implementation pass the tests?) or should grading rather be based on an internal view (are the things implemented by the student correct if seen individually?).One important remark: In this specific scenario, students were not given the unit tests, since they are expected to test their implementation themselves.",2018-12-11 21:20:59,6328,True,368,14,1,4,"['grading', 'homework']",7,False

759,5371,Quizzes after lectures,"I put together elaborate, very carefully planned out lectures, complete with highly distilled exemplars, student teach-backs, and mid-lecture activities to check for understanding.  I've had feedback that my students really enjoy these lessons and appreciate how much work I put in to making sure that my examples are really clear.  However, it has come to my attention that, perhaps due to a course structure which gives students lots of chances to re-demonstrate mastery if they initially struggle, a certain number of the students are only half-engaged with my lecture.  Since I realized this, I have spoken to a few of them, and they agree that the lessons are fun, but say that they are stressed by other courses, and sometimes this causes them to work on other things.On one level, I don't mind this.  Student stress is real, and I have ample evidence to demonstrate to me (or to others!) that the students ultimately master the material that I teach them.  On another level, however, being lax about this does a disservice to them (as we could progress faster for everyone if kids took the learning opportunity more seriously), and to me, as I have put almost unreasonable amounts of time into distilling rich and complex ideas into explanations that are both beautiful and clear.  I'm further motivated by the fact that I get evaluated by my administrators, and I have now been dinged twice by having some of the kids off-topic for short bursts.I'm toying with the idea of adding little, basic quizlets to the ends of my lectures for which students would be immediately responsible.  The questions would purposefully not be difficult.  They'd be more on the level of, ""were you paying attention to what we just did?""  Basic recall, simple factoids, etc.  I already give a difficult test or quiz at the end of the unit, so I don't need this quiz to do much more than (1) give students a chance to dredge up information from memory1 and to help motivate students to take fuller advantage of the lesson opportunities I am giving them.My question, then, is two-fold: (1) are quizlets a good solution to my problem?

770,5403,Students seem to be unable to use code to express their ideas. Is the teaching methodology improvable?,"In my beginner experience as a teacher, the thing that's strucking me most is a sensation of my students' inability to express their (valid!) thoughts in code. Let me deepen it a bit.I inherited a last year class that was supposed to know C from their previous years. Anyway they struggled in manually tracing the execution of the code they see, being it mine or theirs.
After some work I could test and evaluate them again and it now seems to me that they are actually quite good at reasoning about a sort of ""abstract idea"" of what they want their algorithms to do: they can use our natural language to say things like scan this, sum that, stop here or there, and they are pretty much correct. What they seem to have big difficulties in is saying the same thing using a formal language.They moreover have this (to me, crazy) habit of writing huge blocks in main() without splitting anything, and even worse the only way they think about of producing output is writing to the world: they don't contemplate returning from a function. One (brilliant!) boy once asked me with big amazement after my seemingly strong assertion: ""oh, so you mean that strlen() is a function?"".
Of course I may understand where this comes from, but I suspect it's not healthy for their learning.It seems to me that a possible reason of this observed behaviour might lie in having taught them to build huge state machines without making them have a clue that they are building huge state machines: they can reproduce some they have already seen but are really lost when needing to make a new one. Even having them apply small modifications seems to me more like a blind trial from their part than some reasoning about the meanings. The building blocks of the language do not play well together in their minds or they are just unable to think about the state transitions in the code.If I have to push myself a bit more I can say that I suspect all this is a reflection of the non composability of state machines, making their use in teaching to absolute novices not effective, whereas functions are known to be composable and would presumably lead to better results, in terms of being a means for mapping an individual's thoughts to formal language.Is my analysis plausible? Have you experienced anything similar? Is there any available scientific literature on these phenomena? How would you test them to investigate deeper their difficulties and how would you try to show them a more effective route? Is there anything you would do to improve the methodology for next classes?Should state machines be introduced somehow more explicitly, with better examples, showing how do they actually solve problems before throwing them to the poor students with a burden of syntax that they know nothing about? They even told me clearly that syntax is the only thing they focused all their energies on in their previous years.What I am doing in younger classes is proposing functions first (as in functional paradigm), to solidify the concept of building a small composable block that has input and output, waiting a bit more in the future to introduce state transitions using the classic drawing turtle of fame with the hope that its visual feedback might make things tangible.",2019-02-14 15:43:03,6546,True,770,10,2,5,"['programming', 'lesson-order']",6,False

two documents: Computing curricula 2005 report and Computer Science Curricula 2013.
The latter, more importantly, lists the knowledge areas and their relative content that an undergraduate student in computer science should know.
The content of each knowledge area is divided in core-topics and elective-topics.What I want to ask is:1) What exactly are the knowledge areas? Are they the fields of computer science where Ph.D. students can focus their research?
If yes, then how about architecture and organization (AR)? Isn't it the knowledge area where only computer/electrical engineers can focus their research?2) Is this curricula applicable worldwide or does each country have its own?3) Some topics are elective.

780,5445,Is the algorithm-recipe analogy a good or a bad one?,"I am growing suspects that the ubiquitous analogy between algorithms and recipes be not so well founded, especially for theoretically oriented students. I am wondering if this may contribute to the evidence of students having difficulties with even simple loops. I believe that bad analogies make more harm than no analogies, so I ask.My wondering is that recipes, if superficially similar to the idea of sequential steps, do not really encode the logic that is sought to be explained: the logic of state transitions.
Of course there are state transitions in recipes, but i do not feel they being the characterising properties, nor are they the target of attention (I also like cooking). State transitions in recipes (and similar physical operations analogies) seem to be not even caused by the ""program"" but just happening because of physics. And typically what we get from students struggles is exactly their inability to follow (or design) state transitions. Probably because a fundamental property of a real computer program is that of being the acting cause and not the observer of state transitions, and this is not captured by the analogy. Another issue is that computing systems are typically discrete while physical analogies tend to be continuous, both in time and measured (variables) dimensions.What screams for attention in recipes are instead ""data"" dependency constraints (cannot throw in the spaghetti before the water boils), or a kind of ""event-driven"" situation, and i do not recall seeing students struggling with data dependencies, which might be because 1. the recipe analogy is good in teaching them or (I suspect more probably) 2. it's not what they need help for: data dependencies being more innate than state transitions, especially in a forcefully sequential environment (of course this is a hypothesis, any experiments known?).On a more concrete side it seems to me that the real world software counterpart of recipes are those things that we usually call scripts: something I love and had made a lot of and which I know perfectly fit their niche problems, but not something that is known for exposing nice theoretical properties, which, I suspect, is what matters more when learning, in order to build a clear mental model of algorithms (and because my pupils are generic science students and not specialist computer developers).Realistic programs, and especially subprograms if we want to divide et impera, are not sequences of operations but sequences of state transitions.What do you think of this analysis? Have any empirical data? Does an analogy that takes more care of state transitions exist and I have missed it?",2019-02-27 21:17:16,6546,True,989,3,0,3,['teaching-analogy'],4,False

782,5451,Examples of innocent looking faulty code for shock effect,"I'm becoming more and more convinced that starting with an imperative attitude is not doing a favor to the students, especially if it's all about scheduling and repeating some scanf and printf in loops.

They are obviously so much confused in thinking that they're doing a minor variation of for (i=0; i<5; i++) printf(""%d\n"", i).Given a function that needs X as input they constantly point out to me that somewhere in the first lines we need to read X from somewhere, they just ignore that we can add another argument as needed.They cannot trace the execution of a for loop, they don't check the loop condition: to them it's just ""I do the body N times"", I don't yet know what do they think of the index used in the loop besides that it magically happens to take the values 0..N-1.I'm on the edge of despair. Just showing them how I'd do something and explaining its operational interpretation obviously doesn't work, they even show a sort of resistance to abandon this method of doing any imaginable thing just by throwing scanf's and printf's around. Do you have any suggestions for better framing their difficulties, or any examples that might be illuminating in this situation?I am finding incredibly difficult to produce some wrong code that might appear correct in their eyes and could possibly shock them and making them understand that things are a bit different from what they believe.

It is a very complex API with many essential details. These details, while useful, are not interesting enough in and of themself to reliably hold my attention for long periods, even if I put in significant effort. I find when I go through the written tutorials that I get very distracted by almost anything. For example, when I was reading about its mechanism for selecting a GPU in a multi-GPU system instead of focusing on the syntax that I want to learn, I ended up thinking about all the implications of such a selection existing, compared to the fact that it does not in OpenGl. Distractions such as that end up drastically increasing the time that I need to spend on the reading, and skimming is not an option either as the details really are important. There are also diminishing returns as my ability to use will power to remain focused diminishes much more quickly than I would like it to (I can only get through maybe ~10 pages of this reading in a single sitting while maintaining the focus that I feel is necessary.)This problem is not unique to Vulkan. I had the same problem, but to a much lesser extent, when learning OpenGl. In that instance, I was able to find video tutorials that explained the necessary concepts very succinctly. This helped both because the explanations were more succinct, with only the necessary information (including theory when appropriate) to use the API (and I could look at written alternatives when I wanted more details). When I attempted this for Vulkan, however, the only video tutorials that I could find were both outdated and contradicted the text tutorials in a few places, making me very weary of using them as I may pick up bad practices or outdated Vulkan. Video tutorials also work well for me as they keep on moving even if I get temporarily distracted, thus pulling my attention back. When reading, if I get distracted I automatically stop reading.I would also like to note that this isn't an issue of lazyness; I am willing to put in significant time to do it, but I find that my ability to focus is quickly diminishing. As such, I ask: How can I learn Vulkan (Ideally, the advice will be applicable to other similar tasks as well) reasonably efficiently and how can I counter the described road-blocks?",2019-03-26 19:01:09,6762,True,"6,230",26,9,11,['self-learning'],1,False

883,5784,How can we determine which students are a good fit for an educational program?,"tl;dr: How should I be thinking about assessing technical experience for admission into an educational program?At my day job, I help run a program that invites undergraduate students to get ""real world"" experience working on a technical project with a team, under the mentorship of a professional software engineer. The program is currently 10 weeks long and involves working remotely on a team of 3 on a Java servlets-based web app.So far, the program has been invite-only, but we're planning to open it up to the public. We're still thinking about ways to do that (might be fodder for a separate question), but in any case we're going to be in a situation where we have more candidates than we can accept.The program is designed to support students with a relatively high experience level. They need to be comfortable coding in Java (including OOP, basic data structures, and tracing through an existing codebase), they need to pick up basic HTML and JavaScript, and they need to quickly grok client-server communications (e.g. get and post requests). Not to mention git, GitHub, Maven, workspace setup, team communication, etc.We're not expecting any of our students to already be experts in any of the above. But they do need to be pretty comfortable asking questions, debugging, reading through documentation, and tracing through code. This is a virtual program where we don't get a lot of 1:1 coaching time with the students, so they need to be pretty self-motivated.My question is: How can I determine which candidates will be a good fit for this program?We've experimented with students assessing themselves as part of the application (e.g. on a scale of 1-5, how familiar with OOP are you?), but IMVHO this ends up not being a good indicator of actual experience level. We've thought about sending out some sort of assignment that they submit as part of their application, but to really test for everything we want, the assignment would be just as complicated as the real codebase we give them. Plus, what we're really trying to test for is a willingness to ask questions, time management, and enthusiasm more than pure technical experience.With all of that in mind, the whole point of the program is to welcome students into computer science and encourage them to pursue a software engineering career, so in a perfect world, the assessment would come across as friendly and not too intimidating.Sorry, this ended up being longer than I intended. I know this is a very broad question, but I'm looking for a general framework for how to think through this. I'd also be curious to learn more about how other groups are handling this.I appreciate any insights into how I should be thinking about this problem.",2019-06-29 02:07:41,2068,True,129,3,1,2,"['best-practice', 'undergraduate', 'assessment', 'student-perceptions', 'outreach']",2,False

I have a background in computer science and my colleagues tend to use the term vector to describe an array in programming languages like C or Java. I particularly HATE this use of the therm vector, since vectors and matrices are mathematical entities that can be added, multiplied and so on, while arrays and multidimensional arrays can't. I know that there are languages that these constructs exists, like MATLAB, but they don't exists natively in the most used general purpose programming languages. In Java there is an data structure called Vector, that is, in fact, a synchronized list that can't be added, for exaxmple. C++ also has a vector data structure/container in STL that is a list too and is not a mathematical vector.I always explain this for my students, that some people call arrays as vectors and multidimensional arrays as matrices and that this is kinda wrong. I tell them that an array can be used to represent a vector, but that it is not a vector! The same for matrices.I would like to know what do you think about it! Do you think that is correct or not to call arrays as vectors? If so, why? Is this ""missconception"" common in your country?EDITI'm sorry if I sounded pedantic.

902,5850,How to recast an ASPX application as Object Oriented,"I am a programmer in a small department creating some new tools and applications with ASPX and SQL, and explaining the methodology to co-workers, and writing documentation (so the question here qualifies as 'teaching'). Having programmed for 30 years and many times created particular systems of multiple connected parts, I think that OOP is probably not the big deal we make of it, but I would like to know how I could have designed the system described below in a more Object Oriented way - to recast it if needed and move forward with more explainable projects in the future. In brief, the ""File Cabinet"" system I created recently is to facilitate recreating the intranet used by hundreds of people where I work. The intranet consists of many thousands of files and links to internal and external pages, programs and tools. The File Cabinet idea says that there are two basic ways to show links on the intranet and allow authorized users to make changes, instead of asking the web maintainer to make every single change for them. The two ways are: Present a folder in the OS as a set of links to files and folders. Users make changes by placing new files in the appropriate place in the filesystem. This display method duplicates some Windows Explorer functionality in a web page.  Provide a method where authorized users can maintain sets of 'Sections' on a Page containing a list of links in each section. The entire page would render just by reading an SQL table listing the sections, and an SQL table listing the links in each section. Users can add and change links and upload files if necessary.  I have it working. The appearance can be customized using a CSS file. The two methods of seeing the content look the same to normal users. Users who can maintain the site already know how to move files around, and can be shown how to use the Editable Links method. These two methods should dramatically reduce the effort of recreating the department's intranet. I used ASPX to define data sources (SQL or the OS filesystem) and ListViews to generate an HTML table or a set of nesting HTML div's to render the content. The code-behind is VB.Net and most of it is just responding to clicks, manipulating the data before presentation and so on. Could this project have been built in an Object Oriented manner? I think that most of the applications I create, particularly for our department's intranet, are not really amenable to OO, because they basically consist of only a data source and rendering method. The complexity has to do with manipulating data as it passes between the source and screen. Is this ""too simple"" for OO? Or just a different kind of situation? Are web applications usually designed with objects?

I have no desire to raise those issues again. However, I do feel that there is some sort of difference in motivation. Not to do with gender, race, income, etc, but just as a human trait. We have the OCEAN traits in Psychology (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Affability / Amiability, and Neuroticism. These seem to be universal. Is motivation something that varies among people? Can differences in motivation affect how hard they study, persevere, self-teach, find alternatives, and other factors that lead to success in studying and in the workplace? Does Motivation vary? (Not the actual question, just the premise.) Is Motivation what we need to focus on regardless of any other factors? (The actual question.) Three factors of motivation are Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. I see those all as being self-defined, relevant only to oneself. I know that since I was a child, anything I chose for myself as my goal, whether learning about electronics, or resisting my schoolwork, I pursued with the greatest force and energy that I could rouse. Everything else was simply not important. So, when I went to college, I already knew I wanted to learn programming, nothing else mattered. I didn't have mentoring, I barely even went to office hours. I just did it on my own, which is what I did in all my pursuits of personal interest, like radio, or learning photography or whatever. So, I am at a loss to understand why college students do not know what they want to major in, or why they are not motivated to work on their core courses. Why don't they leave college and just do what they actually wish to instead? My guess is that because I was Introverted (one of the OCEAN traits) I preferentially chose tasks for myself that were intrinsically rewarding when pursued alone, and which could not be blocked by having no access to other people. 'Others' and their preferences were the block, so I ""routed around"" it. Please enlighten me. Maybe motivation is bimodal, and is the real issue underlying inequity, etc? if I understand other people better, I can do better.

This is excellent and works well for many of our courses, especially the introductory courses.We also use it for courses that teach more advanced algorithmic concepts, focusing on run time. We have exercises that ask them to implement for example dynamic programming solutions in $O(n^2)$ time.
Currently we use the automated tests to check for the functional requirements and have some tests with larger datasets and a time out to hopefully distinguish between $O(n^3)$ and $O(n^2)$ solutions.Perhaps to nobody's surprise this system is not perfect, with some students optimising the wrong parts of their code to hand in an $O(n^3)$ (or worse) solution and get it through the tests. Thus for the graded assignments our TAs also check all of these by hand to make sure the solution is really $O(n^2)$ and they deduct some points if it is not.My question is, do you know of systems or methods that can automatically check the run time complexity of code (in terms of big-O), rather than the actual run time (in seconds)?In case this is relevant: the programming language used at our university is Java.(NB: I've seen this question and appreciate the concerns about including this in grading.

920,5922,methods early in Java - before objects,"Does it make sense to introduce methods even before objects? What we are attempting to do is to get students out of the ""everything in main()"" mode as soon as possible. Suppose one starts out with a simple program to compute the roots of a quadratic equation. One can imagine the main() method (very early in the course) looking something like:Now we want to introduce methods to demonstrate decomposition into methods invoked from main()t each of which does some parts of the work. One can imagine method signatures like:If we want to call these methods from main() the methods must be declared static. Alternatively one can create an instance of the class and invoke the (non-static) methods via the instance. But, we really haven't discussed objects yet (or at least objects the student writes). Our group is split between the static vs non-static approach. The other split involves passing both objects and primitives to methods as this can get into the discussion of pass-by-reference. However, the latter discussion can be brought up later when revisiting methods in future work.If we go the static route, then later we must point out that many/most methods are non static. If we go the new X() route, one ends up talking about constructors, even if we use a default constructor.Where and how do you introduce method in your first programming course? Is the proposed structure too advanced? How might you alter it?ThanksUPDATE 1:I mostly agree with Objects early, but I wanted to do methods even before
conditionals. I have students
use Objects before creating their own classes. Thus the many small methods. Yes, it is encapsulated in a class, but I don't need to deal with constructors yet.
My style of programming was dramatically changed when I took MIT's SICP at HP in the
1980's.To flush out my ideas I created the following:
QuadEqn. 
The assignment consists of several parts. Part A is designed to be completed
before conditionals are introduced. Parts B, C, and D come later, perhaps as
lab short exercises rather that full blown assignments. I have run this by our
undergrad TA's but would like to solicit additional feedback as well.Again, thanksUPDATE 2:Thanks for all the valuable feedback!

921,5925,Teaching data structures with C++: should I go with smart instead of raw pointers?,"I teach an intro to programming course which covers mostly the basics (data types, control flows, functions, arrays, pointers, singly linked lists, circular linked lists, doubly linked lists, without any OOP concepts). The course is taught using C++ but the focus is not on C++ but on the core concepts (the language is just there for implementation, so we only cover the very basics of it).So far we've been using raw pointers to build linked lists. But I was wondering if students would benefit from switching to smart pointers. I know there are many pros to smart pointers, but I also fear students (who are novice to programming) would ""get used"" to leaving the cleanup to the compiler, as they wouldn't need to worry about dangling pointers or memory leak problems.I think the benefits of raw pointers are that students acquire good practices (same reason they don't learn about high-level structures like vectors or maps yet, until they go on the next course and start with OOP). Also I think raw pointers could be a more ""standard"" way to learn linked lists, since the course doesn't focus on C++ but on the programming fundamentals, and the more C++ specific it gets, the harder it might be to transfer these concepts to a different language.So for now I've always believed it a good idea to stick to raw pointers, but I don't want to trust my (limited) knowledge on the matter and would like to hear other opinions :)",2019-09-19 18:07:14,4062,True,92,2,0,2,['pointers'],2,False

925,5935,"Teaching past the ""symbology"" of a language","I've been recently helping someone with their beginners Python programming course at their university (though I don't think the specific language is particularly important). At times I'm frustrated, because I seem to be unable to push them to bridge, what seems to me to be, incredibly small leaps in logic. At one point there was a question that stated ""using the solution to Q1, solve Q2, but do it for a range of numbers"".  They were able to do Q1 on their own, they were able to independently understand ranges in python, and how to iterate over them, and create lists with ranges. What they couldn't seem to understand, is that basically copying and pasting the code from Q1 into the for loop would do exactly what they asked. I tried to present analogous scenarios to give hints, heck tie it to real life (""you know how to make an omelette, what do you need to do to make 10?"").  They seemed to ""get"" these other things, but when it came to looking at code and trying to apply the same logic, they just straight up had no idea what to do. After a long time they were not able to grasp the problem, and I didn't feel comfortable literally just telling them the answer.  They eventually talked to another person who gave them a solution (not what they used) and that helped them finish their own independent solution that was 99% of the way there. After the class after the homework was due, they noted how they essentially ""face palmed"" after the professor explained the expected solution (basically copy paste Q1, as I described).I think part of the issue is that they have yet to cover functions, which would make it a whole lot easier: abstract away the Q1 part of the question, and thus make it easier for them to make that leap.  On the other hand I fear that I'm too far removed from the point where I had started learning to relate to their learning experiences (I remember when I didn't even understand for loops, so at least I know I had some of the same issues when I was younger).Is there anything I can do in these types of scenarios?",2019-09-25 20:23:12,3168,True,145,3,0,2,"['teaching-analogy', 'struggling-students']",4,False

Everything even remotely technical gets hidden from users, there's dozens of mechanisms protecting you from all kinds of stuff and phones generally are a black box that you're supposed to just consume on.So from my experience, most people are overwhelmed by even the most simple things, like working in a folder structure or the realization that you can use a keyboard to make the computer do things or that error messages can contain more than just ""Oops, something happened"" and that you should please read them before shouting for the teacher that ""It just doesn't work!""Now am I just having nostalgia or is my observation valid?I would suppose there should be some literature on this subject, but this is totally out of my field, and google scholar doesn't bring up anything useful when looking for ""computer literacy"" smartphones.

943,5995,Students' confusion over C structure members and structure variables,"Before I ask my question, some background may be apposite to provide context. Please indulge me.At the institute I teach, our Intro to Programming. It involves a coverage of C language. We believe C is the most foundational and least verbose of most of the popular and heavily used modern languages, such as C++, C#, Java, Python etc. (you may not agree with our position, but that’s a discussion for another day). Our institute trains people in various trades and skill areas including programming. We try to attract people to programming, by allowing them to take our Intro to Programming course regardless of what they registered to learn.Our Intro to Programming class thus is a mix of different students from different backgrounds and at different levels of education (O’ level students looking to prepare for exams or learn a skill, under- and post grads, self-taught people, professional programmers crossing over to C who feel they need a sound foundation, our registered programming trainees etc.)We attempt to give them sound fundamentals covering history of programming, basic concepts, variables, i/o, sequential, branching and looping constructs, doing maths with C, functions, data structures fundamentals, arrays and pointers. After covering up to arrays and pointers, we teach them C-structs. My experience has been: the students learn up to arrays easily, get some trouble with pointers but get by after a lot of scaffolded and non-scaffolded exercises. However, when it comes to C-structs, it takes a lot of effort to get them to understand even the basic concepts of C-structure members and struct variables. They confuse struct members with variables and try to declare or access members the way they would an ordinary variable as I would show below.Though I try to make the concept of structs as intuitive as possible, I run regularly in to this confusion in students. Consider this snippet below, as a typical example of what I use to introduce structs.  The example, struct MyshoppingCart has 3 members (orangeNos, grainKgs & meatKgs) and 3 variables: my cart content for Monday (cartM), for Wednesday (cartW) and my cart contents for Sunday (cartS).With a simple struct like this, students show three difficulties.If you tell them cartM and cartW in the example above are struct variables, they ask why then are they not declared inside as members like int orangeNos; and double grainKgs; If I explain they are not inside because they represent an instance of the structure, they get more confused.If I try to explain different ways to declare struct variables i.e. method 1: right after and following the closing brace of the struct definition and method 2: inside main using the name of the structure as prefix, the confusion increases. It takes lengthy explanation and many examples to get some semblance of understanding from many of the students.When you get to accessing members of the structure and you tell the students, we can do this by using the dot notation as in:(Code example)A student will just go ahead in accessing say orangeNos; to write something like:You tell him/her it’s wrong and: All hell just gets foot lose! They… just…. don’t …. get it …..EASY! He/she gets more confused!My Question is:Are these difficulties symptoms of cognitive overload? Or what could be the likely problem?I have tried questioning students, but I have not gotten answers that may give me insight to the root of the problems. Has anyone encountered similar problems teaching C-structs and how did you overcome it; getting students to learn it like a breeze?

There were no extra points.Here, I was wondering can I/ should I have a ""simplified"" assignment that would be ""easier"" and be weighted ""downwards"".The class have previously completed a use case (table and diagram) for accessing a course on Coursera, so they had to identify a range of use-cases, including identifying 'extend' and 'include' cases.I teach a course (introductory) in software architecture at roughly the level of first year in third level.  The outline for the assessment (1 of 8 summative assessments) states ""Derive a test case from a provided use case"".  Examples in class were the ""classic"" ATM test-case, as well as a vending machine and an e-payment site.At the same time, in another module (code) we used the doctest module (Python) with the testmod() function to check test cases in the docstring.
I created a simple use-case diagram for submitting an assignment on Moodle.  There are a number of test cases that this prompts.  I am/was considering another (perhaps simpler) use case based around the type of code we did in class and this prompts several types of exceptions and even an alternate flow.  I wrote some code here as an example of what I am considering.  The test-case template would have to be completed by the learner to show that they have considered all the possible problems that can arise... for example, a negative int should raise a ValueError, using two strings should raise a TypeError and so on.I did a sample test-table in class based on a area_circle(rad) function, and so I was thinking this might be an option for the ""less confident"" (as described on CS50 pset2 referenced in the first link) but as I think about it more, if the learner completes this then they achieve the learning outcome, and I should NOT have it weighted to be of less worth than one which could be considered more difficult.Now, after all this, I am inclined towards giving both options to the class, with no differentiation between points, but I still wonder:1) Should I offer both options?2) Is there ever a case for creating an assessment with ""less worth"" to allow a learner achieve some marks, or if the ""lesser"" task demonstrates that they meet a learning outcome, is this unfair?Has anyone done something like this (easier version with less points) I know I could have been more succinct in my question, but appreciate any feedback you can give.

949,6022,"Simple, Compact, Rounded Definition of the term ""Programming Construct""","A younger friend of mine, a high school student I have been encouraging to take his Computer Studies class seriously, and possibly go for CS in tertiary education, brought this problem to me. He was given a term paper by his teacher in the course of which he had to discuss language constructs in programming. Being a diligent student, he had done most of the assignment but wanted to impress his teacher in addition with a definition of the term language construct as used in programming. He showed me his jottings from books and on-line but complained he could not find definition he could quote or material simple enough to enable him create a very good definition of his own. In spite of this, he came up with and showed me his definition below:He wanted my opinion on whether the above definition will be satisfactory for his teacher. I was uneasy to say ok/not ok. I felt the definition was too fuzzy but I could not come up immediately with something more accurate YET WITH LANGUAGE SIMPLE ENOUGH to be at his vocabulary level! This is the dilemma. So I searched in the literature available to me, on-line too. I even read this thread on StackOverflow:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057524/what-does-language-construct-mean
and this one on Quora: 
 https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-construct-in-programmingI got many explanations but no compact definition. I thought hard about it. I made no headway. I also found this definition from Wikipedia (which incidentally is the only one that came close to a compact definition of the term):“A language construct is a syntactically allowable part of a 
 program that may be formed from one or more lexical 
 tokens in accordance with the rules of a programming 
 language. The term Language Constructs is often used as 
 a synonym for control structure, and should not be 
 confused with a function.”However, the definition was full of jargon and bombast (""syntactically allowable"", ""lexical ..."") which were way over my friend’s head. Furthermore, the last sentence of the Wikipedia definition begged a question of what is and what is not a programming construct. Considering it, shall we say class, object, structures, hash tables and such are not programming constructs? We tried to pick elements of the Wikipedia definition, translate it to simpler language and incorporate in my friend’s definition, and the result got verbose and so long, it lost the compactness of a definition. The target is to come up with a definition of the term programming construct” that is simple, within the vocabulary level of a high school student, precise enough to clearly delimit the scope of where construct starts and where it ends (so one can easily see what is a construct and what is not). I and my friend have discussed in the last three days on it and we seem to be getting into an intellectual quagmire: the more we try to step forward, the more intractable it gets.I bring this here because we are teachers. As teachers, we are used to having to define basic concepts. I am hoping to get some precision and lucidity that AUGMENTS my friend’s definition and makes it more rounded. Lets help a serious young man who has done his due diligence and needs some scaffolding. Thanks people. Just a lucid, compact and rounded definition at the vocabulary level of a high school student please. (I will ensure you are acknowledged in my friend's paper if your definition is not an extension of his, and is used by him).",2019-11-02 21:51:25,8489,True,72,0,0,2,"['student-motivation', 'high-school', 'introductory-lesson']",1,False

We want our students to be forced to work exclusively in the shell to improve their comfort and skills with terminals - they already have considerable familiarity with IDEs. To achieve this, I want my students to be able to SSH into a shared server with unique logins. They should then work in their little sandbox and submit their work in specific directories that I will auto-grade from an admin login.I'm currently trying AWS's basic EC2, but it's unclear if all of the following is possible: 1) Add username/passwords on TOP of a RSA keypairs. It seems clear that I can do unique keypairs OR username/password, but not yet clear if I can do both...2) How to use just 1 RSA keypair for all student logins, rather than a different keypair for each login (to facilitate quick distribution/set-up, and to control security at-large conveniently)3) How to let users set their own passwords - ideally initial password is universal, but on day 1 they could personalize.I'm starting to suspect AWS may not be the best solution for what I'm trying to accomplish.

952,6032,"How do you wow second-year students into saying ""bare-metal programming is cool!""?","Next semester I will be TAing a computer organization/assembly language course. I will be full-fledgedly (co-)teaching the lab. The first lab will take place before the first lecture, so me and the other TA will partly be responsible for preparing the students to not resent this class they're forced to take. At this point, the students have taken an intro class with Python and a class on OO concepts in Java, and they might be taking a language-agnostic algorithms class at the same time. The professor's standard way of motivating the concept on the first day is showing how going through an array column by column is slower than row by row even though they give the same result using the same approach.Therefore, I have to motivate on two fronts: why is assembly programming (or even C) interesting/relevant, and why is computer organization interesting/relevant. The latter may seem obvious if you're already in the know, but it sure didn't for me before I took this very course.Here are some of the points that I already intend to include in my opening spiel (everything that starts with a backslash is spurious):""If you go into data science: the information in this course will explain why certain programs are slow, which is important if you're churning a lot of data.
\You will learn how to write faster programs in general.
You will understand how computers actually work, no magic [I don't have to mention that they won't learn everything].
\This class might make you interested in systems-level programming, even considering a career.

This class will teach you how to do what they do.""What are some other motivators that I can include?EDIT: Just to be clear: I have no control over the lab, and definitely none over the lecture.

Brown and Greg Wilson at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886386/  It had many useful suggestions one of which was “Don’t just Code” which I deciphered as: in addition to making students write code, we can also make them look at code and make meaning of it or engage with it in some way that gets them to think computationally. One way to do this they suggested was using Parsons Problems (That one is new to me).  I quote them here:I looked up the researches referred to above as [20, 27]. The 20 reference at http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2839509.2844617 validated and extended the original Parsons’ research at: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1151869.1151890They implemented their Parsons Problems as web based drag and drop exercise. I get the general sense of how to create Parsons Problems. I want to use them. But I work in a part of the world where internet service is expensive and sometimes erratic. Similarly with electric power supply. So I wanted to design a paper based or some non-computer-based, physical media form of Parsons Problems that does not require use of electrical power or web access. I want to begin to use them in my lab/revision classes. However the logistics of their construction and use on non-computer media is not clear and/or problematic to me.One option I considered was using flash cards with codes written on them for students to rearrange in the correct order of the code. One challenge with flash cards is the bulk. For example, consider an Intro Programming Class with students from several departments as high as 70 or more. Suppose you need a set of say 8 flash cards carrying the code for one program.  For a class of 70 students, that would amount to producing 70 sets of 8 flash cards (i.e. 560 cards). Multiply this for say 300 some exercises for different topics and different programming subjects and you begin to see the challenge. There are resource constraints here. There is also problems of handling the bulk, and keeping the cards in good condition from one use to another etc.Any ideas how one can produce non web-based Parsons Problems in some (preferably, physical/hard copy) form that is much cheaper, less bulky, durable and yet engaging for the students i.e. they don’t just write answers, they shuffle and move, and do some activity with the options?",2019-11-06 22:11:45,8489,True,58,2,1,1,"['lesson-ideas', 'resource-request', 'labs']",1,False

When I started the job a few years ago I basically just continued what the previous teacher was doing. Students propose a project during the first two weeks and then have the year to build it. The biggest catch is that there's almost no accountability for the students. I'm wanting to change it into a more formal curriculum, and I'm leaning towards a languages class. These are 3rd or 4th-year students that have taken AP-A and Data Structures which are both taught in Java and may have a bit of experience with Python or JavaScript depending on the year. So with that lead-in, I'm looking for some feedback on the plan.We do 6, six-week grading terms. The plan is to do a different language each six-weeks.

Specifically. the class is an objects-late approach, and by this point, they've seen the standard imperative control flow constructs, static method definitions, and object usage, though not yet class definitions.  They're about to learn arrays, and they'll see class definitions and the basic notions of inheritance and encapsulation behind interfaces after that.  Up to this point, they've learned to write console-based applications, with input taken from command line arguments or else interactively, using Scanners.At this very moment, I want to detour in to graphics, because algorithmic art is wonderful, and students love it.  In the past, I've used Swing for this, starting from the templates in David Eck's textbook (Introduction to Programming Using Java).  Here, for example, is a simple program that repeatedly prompts the user for (x,y) coordinates and a color choice, then displays a dot at that location and color (as you can see, this one was shown after introducing arrays, but before class definitions):The primary interaction is the loop in main that prompts for coordinates, adds entries to the parallel arrays, and calls the JPanel's repaint() method.  No class definitions, no lambdas or ActionListeners, no invocation of separate threads via a run() method.  It is as simple as I know how to make graphics at this level, while still using a real-world Java framework.I cannot figure out how to do this kind of interaction in JavaFX, within these constraints.  Here's where I'm stuck:Yes, I realize that I can get the effect I want by adding a runLater() call, to dispatch a separate thread.

987,6134,An Intro to CS course in C++ for CS majors: laying a solid low-level foundation or simple tools and algorithmic thinking?,"Consider the following two competing incentives in teaching a first Intro to CS course for CS majors. In my case, the course must use C++ -- that's a given.The first incentive is that the course needs to provide a solid foundation, which includes understanding how things work under the hood and implies teaching pointer, raw array and string, dynamic allocation etc.The second incentive is the focus on developing algorithmic thinking and taste for elegant code. This incentive seems to be served best by teaching the smallest and the simplest-to-use possible subset of the language sufficient to solve algorithmic problems, gradually getting to the level of problems used in informatics olympiads for high school. So, for example, std::vector would be taught instead of raw array and pointers would not be mentioned. This would probably also mean excluding the need to handle errors in the exercises, so as to not spoil the taste of writing short and elegant code.Which approach is preferred? Or maybe a third approach?Clarifications following the reply by @Ben I.I am presenting this as a choice between two approaches, because I believe that the two approaches are in conflict. Low-level features of the language are complicated. To help students understand them, one needs to give a lot of technical examples and exercises. This totally takes the focus away from algorithmic thinking.Also, I am writing under the assumption that, once I am convinced about the correct way of teaching, I can try to convince my colleagues to consider changes in the follow-up courses as well. Right now the curriculum is built on the first approach. The big picture that I see is that there are many CS graduates who know programming languages, but few who are good programmers. Look at the questions at leetcode.com. Almost all of them are about algorithmic thinking, because employers are looking for good programmers.",2020-01-08 21:37:51,8794,True,107,3,2,4,['c++'],2,False

I need to quickly understand her misconceptions, as she is saying that she has many doubts, she says ""the char function"", ""the for function"", ""no idea what ++ is"" and the like.She looks brilliant nonetheless, besides having great confusion on cs things (and a decreasing engagement of course), therefore I'd prefer a very direct and practical way of getting to her errors, not spending a lot of time repeating concepts that might bore her. I'm quite good at understanding my pupils' mind maps given their answers and fix them but not so good at creating questions/problems that pose the right challenges and let the misconceptions provoke errors in their solutions, mostly because it all seems too simple to me whereas it looks like many students find this topic complex. The only thing that comes to my mind is generating a lot of situations hoping to see her wrong somewhere, clearly not a systematic approach.Let's say, in our terms, that I don't know well how to identify the corner cases that I ought to be testing and I feel like risking to follow only the happy paths of her thought processes.For example, I read somewhere that a common misconception is to think that given something like while (relation) { ... } then the student thinks that whenever the relation becomes false something happens (break? I don't know), anywhere in the midst of the block. (I have a compelling feeling of why this specific case might happen).What are, from your experience (hoping not to make the question too subjective), or from literature, the most common misconceptions and false beliefs that beginning students have?

It seems like it would be good to have some consensus about whether or not graduate programs in CS, or jobs in CS, would hold it against CS majors if they took a CS course pass/fail this semester instead of for a grade. Many students are facing severe displacement (e.g. living in quarantine camps in their home countries, lacking reliable internet at home, needing to take on jobs to help their family pay bills after a layoff, etc).

And what I noticed is that usually the lecturer has a lot of interruptions from people who ask them to repeat something, to clarify on a topic, or they even divert the topic to ask something else (like ""can I do the same thing with a different IDE?"").When I teach on-site I notice I don't have as many questions as I've observed here (probably because ""hiding"" behind a computer screen makes people more comfortable to ask questions). And I really welcome all kinds of questions and hate it when someone gets behind just because they're afraid to ask.So I'm trying to find a balance here. It would be a great thing if I had someone assisting students, so they can go on a private chat with whoever is asking a question and answer without disrupting the class. But that's not a possibility here. It's just me. And I also know another option would be to say all questions will be answered at the end of the lecture, but I'm hesitant on this since the risk of leaving people behind during the class is higher.Any other ideas on how to handle this?

1026,6282,Seeking advice on mentoring without participating in exam cheating in the new chaotic environment of the pandemic,"I mentor online (in assembly language and computer architecture) at codementor.io.  The way I work is to have a zoom meeting with a student to instruct them on what they are confused or stuck on.More and more, due to changes in the way course work is being carried on during the epidemic, I'm having new students as me for help with take home exams.  Of course, I won't do that if I know it is happening.Many of these such requests directly and blatantly ask for help with an exam; however some students appear to have lied that they are doing practice exams or have homework assignment they need some help with when it really was a take home exam.Here's what I do when I encounter a new student asking for help.I get concerned if the time frame is either immediate or very specific time (say tomorrow) and/or there are multiple question that are somewhat randomly related and it is not obviously a practice exam.But with the latest changes, moving to home and online study, more and more I'm seeing exams being given as take home and with a two or so day time period, so my approaches to detecting situations that I don't want to be in are not working as well as I'd like, and, I'm being approached more often.It's a tough situation and I do sympathize with students because at least right now with sudden changes there is some chaos; many are not getting the instruction they need and help from faculty, and for the moment, increasingly so because of the pandemic.Further, instructors — who are suddenly shifting from in-class exams to take home exams — are probably not versed in best practices against cheating.My question is, does anyone have any advice on the subject, e.g. on how to help honest students (e.g. practice exams, theory, etc..) while avoiding cheating on exams?",2020-04-09 22:19:50,3799,True,107,3,0,1,"['exams', 'cheating', 'mentoring']",3,False

One complaint is that some member doesn't actually do anything, causing dissension or the failure of the project altogether. Too often, left to their own devices, teams simply ""divide up the work"", ignoring that separate threads need to be integrated and that this can be the major part of the effort. My joke example is five people writing a 5000 line program with one person writing the first thousand lines, the next person writes the next thousand, etc. All in parallel. But imagine also a team project in which a Limerick is to be written with each member writing one line, all in parallel. The opposite effect is when one student simply does everything, ignoring everyone else on the team. And often, then, complains that they got no help. How much prior instruction about team process is required before such assignments are given? More important, what should that instruction include? It might also be useful to comment on how much the evaluation should correspond to the process and not just the product produced. There are a number of smaller issues within this question, of course, such as what does it mean to ""contribute equally"". How can we convey good team practice in light of such issues?

They've also mentioned that Discord was a good choice because they were already there, and so, they didn't need to install another app and create another account. They were also looking for an away to stay closer to the teacher.So, I decided to give it a try. I've created a ""server"" and invited them to that server. After a session with them, I've sure realized that for the classes Discord is not as good as Zoom, however, for a more informal way of contact with the students it may be a good choice.

My field is geographic information systems. The goal for the course is for the students to understand scripting in an interpreted language so that they can automate analytical workflows or add custom functionality to off-the-shelf software. The language we use is Python, but the question is more general than that.Programming languages have some way of obtaining input and displaying output. There is a long tradition in computer science of starting with ""Hello, World!"" as a basic program that produces output. Additionally, output statements can be used to display the state of variables for debugging purposes. Introducing input and output is common in computer science textbooks (Think Python 1.3 The first program) as well as domain specific texts such as the one that I use for this course.The problem I am running into is that beginning students can't seem to unlearn this after we move on to new material. Throughout the semester they turn in assignments that are littered with unnecessary print statements. These are ""harmless"" in the sense that they don't alter program logic, but make for sloppy code, and are perhaps not harmless if the students think that they need to do this and don't transition to, for example, using the IDE for variable inspection as they code.Is there pedagogical value?

If so which parts of it?I was studying in a university in Russia. I don't want to name its name and location. I wanted to become a software developer. Following some people's advice I entered a faculty that was mostly about math. All its teachers are mathematicians. So most of our subjects were just different kinds of math. There also was some programming but much less. I was told by other students and teachers that how I pass Calculus and Algebra exams was the most important thing and that programming exams were unimportant at all. Many different teachers and students were saying that ""a university does not need to teach programmers"". They say that ""it's not science"" and ""it's nothing but craftsmanship"". During a defense of diploma people sometimes ask programmers something like ""That's all interesting but that's not math so why it's a diploma work?""When I talked with people who were actually working as software developers they were saying that ""If you don't how to fix problems with Linux and don't know a single architecture pattern then as a programmer you are really nothing"". They also said that ""I wouldn't hire a developer who doesn't tell me that HP-UX is a bad OS when I mention it"". In university we spent a single lecture on patterns(and not even all students but some) and none on Linux and other operating systems. And I knew literally nothing about HP-UX. I had to learn 90% of my skills myself via books, online-tutorials and documentation.In our country IT is a very popular industry. Because of that the math faculty students are 90% wannabe programmers. Teachers really hate that as they want math to be popular again. They say that ""computer science ate math""(That's citation of a teacher during a lesson, ""Информатика съела математику""). The teachers despise us programmers. The employers in Russia prefer candidates with a degree but will gladly accept those without it. The students try to pass all exams only to have the degree, they don't care about subjects at all. They forget everything when they come out of a room after an exam. It's seems like students and teachers declared war against each other.I left university without any degree. Now I work as JS-developer. I myself participate in interviews to hire new developers. I ask them about things like Single Responsibility Principle, how to write clean code and how to create indexes in SQL. I know that SRP is not a law of physics, it comes without a good scientific proof.

Each and every algorithm in it is written in the simplest manner possible. Each and every algorithms have analysis involved in a hardcore manner. Thought it is a fantastic book on algorithm design and analysis and many sources recommend it for data structures as well but I find that the data structures section is quite less in the above book.I have gone through the data structure book below :$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad$Data structures using C and C++ by Tanenbaum et. alThough the above book deals with the various topics of data structure I found that many of the implementations of the data structures and their manipulation algorithms have been made unnecessarily complex and it took quite a lot of time to understand certain pieces of codes which otherwise could have been written in a much more elegant manner. This makes it difficult to recall the algorithms in the text which is far beyond intuition at some places. Though the book contains algorithms of the data structure manipulations but at most places the hardcore analysis is missing.So could any one recommend me a book on data structure which is as elegant as CLRS , simple and lucid, which would help me for myself study. Even if it does not revolve around any particular programming language - it is fine, but if it does it would it be good if the language is a modern one and not the older ones like PASCAL, FORTRAN,...

Currently it uses C, and while I'm personally very fond of C, it does usually overwhelm the students to learn C enough in order to be able to complete the practical exercises.However, the focus of the course is not to learn a language but rather the concepts and applying them in small exercises, while getting a ""feel"" for operating systems or low-level development.Issues students had with C:A few of these issues could be addressed with Rust:Other languages and their issues:However Rust has many abstractions that actually stop us from being able to really 'go down' the stack and look 'into' what's happening (at least, without understanding the details of Rust which isn't the goal).  For example for the students to fiddle around with syscalls they are supposed to write a small cat(1) program using open,close,read,write(3) etc.  There's of course the libc crate but using that basically requires knowledge of C and Rust to really deal with things.  I thus drafted a small library which I currently host here with really thin abstractions around those syscalls that make dealing with them from Rust quite nicer. 1The code logic is now quite similar, but hopefully the easier tooling helps the students:Becomes:And similarlyis now:I also think it's far less confusing for students to have ""return values"" to be separate from program ""exit codes"".  However I'd like to hear some opinions or get some feedback whether you think this is worth pursuing.For those wanting to try this, in Cargo.toml add:Some things are lost when using Rust.  Since cargo now handles building, the possibility to learn about (Preprocessing) -> Compilation -> Assembly -> Linking is lost.  While the goal is not to be CLI compilation magicians, I think understanding this pipeline does help to reason about certain OS behavior.  However one might rightfully argue that this is simply too in-depth for a 5 CP second semester course anyway.1 However this library should not be used in the real-world as it simply wraps the low-level functions in the libc with unsafe blocks and does some ugly casting.",2020-07-16 16:45:19,9311,True,224,4,0,1,"['programming', 'language-choice', 'c', 'operating-systems']",2,False

About three years ago, I started tutoring ages grade 6 through adult in coding topics.I like my code to be simple and comprehensible, with the feeling of confidence that it works... a simple thought process by which I can understand (and anyone can understand) what my code does.So I teach that. I teach breaking things into encapsulated sections, I teach testing and debugging techniques.I also teach how to make use of your brain better and work smart, not hard.Several of my students have been with me for three years, and they've all grown a lot, and they're a pleasure to work with because they picked up this clean thought style.But... is this the only approach to teaching?

Keep in mind that I'm a bit obsessive and probably could stand to lighten up a little and let my students work in whatever way they would like.Recently a student came to me, interested in doing US Computing Olympiad problems. The thing is, he had barely learned anything about coding. He had a little Java knowledge, but was weak on creating classes and really didn't even understand how to use functions. I suggested that we work on fundamentals and he balked - from his point of view, you didn't need functions to solve these problems, and he had searched the web for other solutions and none of them used functions. (All the code is in main())At first I figured he was in for a disappointment when he realized these problems were over his head. Well, shiver me timbers, he has solved about 10 problems so far using this technique. I can't even figure out what his code is doing or why it should work.He doesn't do testing even! He just submits his code and keeps tweaking it until it passes the online judge test cases.So I finally said that consider it a limitation on my part, I'm only really able to work in my normal method and that if he really doesn't want to do things my way, he has to find a tutor who can work with him like this.Finally there came a reason why he's interested in me and my methods - he did see that it would be useful to test and debug, and he did find a few USACO solution online that used functions and classes, so now he has a mild interest in learning that from me.I guess what I'm asking then, is when you are mentoring someone, how do you negotiate this balance between ""teaching them clean work"" and ""let them work in the method most natural to them""?",2020-08-30 00:27:19,9246,True,"4,269",26,5,11,"['java', 'algorithms']",13,False

The core document that we have been using was the ACM Computing Curricular Guidelines from 2013. At the beginning of this year, it emerged the ACM Computing Curricula 2020, which I believe is an improvement over the original document from ACM circa 2005, which defined the guidelines of CS-related careers. The document can be found on:https://cc2020.nsparc.msstate.edu/Here I have some doubts about this initial draft. I have seen that (in my personal opinion) it is a little bit awkward. It mentions the different ""flavors"" of CS worldwide, and then it shows some tools that could be used to measure to see how much CS one career has, even though it does not mention where and how to use these tools. The nice thing about this document is that it contains a set of competencies that should be attained from each undergraduate CS-related field, which, by the way, vaguely reminds me of the ABET competencies system. However, I miss the style of the Curriculum Guidelines of 2013; in which there were recommendations on how to distribute the Body of Knowledge into different Knowledge Areas. Also, even it gave a summary of the recommended topics in each Tier (core or elective).In summary, I would like to know if one should use this document of 2020 in conjunction with the document that appeared in 2013. Maybe is that ACM will develop another document as an upgrade to the 2013 curriculum guidelines?

1113,6547,"Student not understanding explanation the 1st, 2nd... and 8th time","I am working for a company, and a target for this year is to increase the level of CS knowledge among the staff.The company does mostly engineering stuff so the people come from an engineering background, they might have some knowledge of programming, such as what is a variable, control flow, etc. but classes are virgin territory. That is kind of the average level there.Me and a few others with knowledge (formal CS background, working in the AI team of the company) were assigned to increase the level of knowledge in the office. Basically each mentor was assigned a handful of mentees and the mentor decided what to teach and what exercises to give etc. to improve the algorithmic thinking and C++ competency.I paired up with a colleague and we pooled our mentees. For some people it worked great. People went from variable names like a, b, ok, x and thousands of lines of copy-pasted code in main() to actually nice variable names, class hierarchies with abstract classes/interfaces, clean code to the point where (almost) no comments were needed, etc.I tend to think that we are doing something right, especially since my colleague and I also teach at our university (which is among the top3 in the country), create training materials, held multiple training sessions on different subjects, regularly mentor interns with great success and also did volunteer work tutoring middle school children in introductory programming, with parents at the end asking us to continue the tutoring for money. So we are not exactly new to teaching, and our experiences seem to indicate that we are not bad at it either.However I have a student that doesn't seem to grasp some concepts at all even after multiple (>5) explanations using different methods and analogies. Will also forget basic techniques in the span of hours.For example he needs a copy of a vector<int> (C++). He will do the old song and dance:We told him several times and explained why it was better, faster, prettier to just do:He always forgot to do this for his homework until we made his homework to clean up his code and implement a single utility function.He cleaned up the code, then in that utility function went right back to the for method. And when we pointed this out it took a couple of minutes and helping questions for him to realize what he did wrong.Another example is that as a first project the mentees have to implement a basic Hill Climbing algorithm.  This project has been given in June. We have people who will begin implementing Genetic Algorithms this week and it won't even be hard for them. People who have started from variable names like a, b, ok, x and thousands of lines of copy-pasted code in main().Without precise instructions he's barely able to create functions like with 1-2 rounds of review ""you get a vector of vectors as an argument. compute f on each of the vectors and return the index of the first vector where the value of f is above some threshold x"".The hill climbing algorithm was explained exactly 7 times to him in different ways, with both me and my colleague actually spending time to come up with new analogies. Every time this mentee will enthusiastically say that this time he understood better than all the other times and then do something like just compute the best neighbor of the starting point and return that neighbor, and then name the function firstImprovement.The problem is that this person does not appear disinterested. When we explain things he nods and looks like he is concentrating and that makes us try again and again because it looks like he's trying too, but the issues above have been a thing for months.

1114,6548,How useful is English (pseudocode and documentation) in aiding understanding?,"I'm a freelance tutor working with high school students, giving them programming assignments in languages like Python, Java, C++, and others.In recent months I've seen the value of using English - getting them to write documentation and also to write down rough drafts of their algorithms in pseudocode. I'm wondering what other teachers do with this. (I'll give an example with an Euler problem.)The goal is to get them to think at a high level. Typically they like to dive into code. It's not concrete to them if they aren't writing code. I get it, developing a higher-level understanding is something that takes time. But I think I need to push it a little - they are just avoiding pseuocode and documentation past the point when they are really ready to use it.One obstacle is their general writing abilities. The students who don't write well in any context, like English class, find it the hardest to write documentation and pseudocode.To give an example, let's consider Euler 46, ""Goldbach's other conjection"" https://projecteuler.net/problem=46This project involves testing different ways of adding squares and primes, in some kind of nested for loop. Typically they want to start out with details likeWhere I have put question marks is where they aren't sure what to put. But they begin wrestling with each place I have put question marks right away. That means they are struggling with low level details right away before they really understand the gestalt of the problem. Also they will throw in a break without having considered ahead of time how that will play out.What I'm trying to get them to do is write pseudocode like this:Of course this is a big leap, so I guide them to it gradually. (The benefits of working as a tutor and not a classroom teacher.) When they think at a high level, they can also see choices available to them. like maybe that pseudocode could be modified to be made more effcient.They can reflect on the difference long before they have wrestled with the details of for loops. They can think about how they might efficiently test if a number is prime. Maybe they've seen before this idea of generating a hash set of primes and think about whether that's faster than trying to find out if a number is a square (which requires a sqrt operation).Then there's documentation. The difference between something low level likeand higher level likeWhat I'm looking for from the answers is whether other teachers have found it useful to bring English into helping them develop higher-level understanding.

Students could easily ask in this case why the client didn't call the Square constructor if the width and length are equal. (I can give them an answer to that question, but it would be better to have an example good enough that they wouldn't even ask.)EditsFor those of you who answered that I shouldn't have a static factory method return an instance of a subclass, not only wasn't that my question but the great Josh Bloch considers that a positive use of static factory methods (Effective Java, Item 1). I recognize no higher Java authority, although you are free too.For those who told me that a good use of static factory methods is that the programmer can choose their name, which is not the case with constructors, I already knew and teach that.

1156,6707,I know C++ 2003 How to start learning C++ 2017?,"Tl;dr - the subject is enough. For background, read below.I am a professional, freelance, embedded software developer. I first learned about C++ in the 90s and taught myself from a book C++ for C programmers.The beauty of that was that it assumed that I knew C and didn't have to spend chapter after chapter explaining how to declare a variable/what a variable is, function/passing parameters/returning a result, loops, etc, etc, etc.So, it cut quickly to the chase and I started learning from page 1, rather than skipping forward.Fast (?) forward a few decades, and I no longer code (much) assembler.  Work seems to be split between C, Ada (mostly for defence) and C++.It has been four years since my last C++ gig, and, industry being conservative does not adopt new version of languages for some time, until they can be seen to be widely accepted as stable (if any of you non-industry guys what to know why, then we generally want to wait until ""they get the bugs out of the new compiler"". Given that a lot of embedded can be life-critical, you can understand why).So, now I am seeing ads requiring C++ 2014 and 2017 (and my latest experience is 2003). The delicious irony of this is that I know, from bitter experience, that coding standards will forbid me from using the new features intruded in those versions.All of my life, I have taught myself new languages & concepts from books. Earlier this year, I took a leap of faith & taught myself Flutter/Dart (for personal, non-professional use) from a Udemy course. That was an eye-opener, and I won't be responsible for the death of any more trees in future.But, I digress (this entire screed has been a digression, if you ask me). I have now purchased another Udemy course to learn C++.And, finally, after all of that, my question is still the same as its title - ""I know C++ 2003 How to start learning C++ 2017 ?"".Do I watch the start of each chapter, and skip if I yawn? Do I read the table of contents and take a stab at where to jump in?Given that you are a group of educators, I imagine that this is not a new situation to you, but am not sure that it has an answer which does not involve the length of pieces of string.",2020-12-29 16:03:01,4116,True,116,3,0,2,['self-learning'],4,False
1157,6709,Some real practical example to teach object-oriented concepts and programming (in python),"I have taught my high school students to write some simple python scripts, taking some ideas from ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"", e.g. changing file names in a folder to a specific naming pattern.My next goal is to teach them object-oriented concepts and if possible give them some ""real"" examples to try themselves. But most of the materials I find (most of google's top search results) about OO programming (not just python) are laden with poor examples, if I may say so. I really don't like to use car/vehicle or animal/dog to teach them the OO concept and OOP.A. it is boring (you know high-school kids)
B. it has no real use.
C. as one comment said ""they are fatally flawed.""  (But if you really like to use the animal example, check this ""Object-Oriented Design"")I plan to use pathlib (btw, they already have a basic idea of the difference between Windows and UNIX)GUI development could be another good example to teach OOP but I don't want to teach them GUI yet.Any suggestion to introduce OO with the ""real"" example?BTW, I’m not a strong advocate of object-oriented programming. But the pathlib.Path class is a useful abstraction especially compared with os.path, although the high school students are unlikely to appreciate that.---- update ----I find the python logging module is another good example, but it seems too complicated for non-experienced programmers.When using the logging module we mainly use 3 objects, Logger, Handler, Formatter. Logger is the facade, as https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#loggers said,Logger objects have a threefold job. First, they expose several methods to application code so that applications can log messages at runtime. Second, logger objects determine which log messages to act upon based upon severity (the default filtering facility) or filter objects. Third, logger objects pass along relevant log messages to all interested log handlers.Handler is a good example to use inheritance https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#useful-handlers and handlers use formatters, which hide the complexity of LogRecord, to the format log message.In addition to these classes, there are a number of module-level functions for convenient use.Overall it is a good example of using composition and aggregation.But I am not an expert on the python logging module, I hope someone who is familiar with the python logging module may add an answer to my question.--- update 2 ----I found Alan Kay answered the question “What are the five features of the object-oriented paradigm that you consider to be important for good software engineering practice?” with these words, in my opinion, resonate with the answer Buffy gave. But how to convey these ideas to high school students or non-experienced programmers is another challenge,a “part” construct that can protect it's inside from its outside, and
vice versaa “communications” construct that can convey interactions and deal
with dependenciesa “system” construct that is a combination of parts and communications
that can fit in a part recursively, and everything is made this waythe “messages” that are communicated are also in terms of the systemsthe system that is being made is made with the same kinds of system
...--- update 3 ---The recent log4j security flaw made me come back to my own although my question has nothing to do with log4j. I know python logging module is adopted from Log4j, so I think this can be used as a good example to how different programming languages borrow the idea from each other. If the students have some knowledge about java, I may consider to introduce them this old article ""Python isn't just Java without the compile""BTW, Buffy gave answer about calculator as an example to practice OO, but I will argue it will depends on how you design the question and the project, e.g. here ""How To Make a Calculator Program in Python 3"" without introducing OO concepts at all.",2020-12-31 09:48:23,9884,True,345,4,0,4,"['lesson-ideas', 'curriculum-design', 'high-school', 'object-oriented-paradigm']",5,False

They are in their second year of college(software engineering), yet barely have complete understanding of the basics. This is partially due to classes falling out due to the Corona crisis, but also in my eyes because their program is slow paced and wrongly focused (Nearly the entire year is dedicated towards HTML/CSS, they barely touched PHP/JavaScript/Databases and had nothing in terms of documentation).This forces me to spend more time doing lectures and teaching them what they were supposed to learn then actually doing my so called ""supervisor"" duties of managing the projects. To help them increase their level of knowledge I started making my own little assignments for them to practice with and referring online tutorials to them but, I can not force them to do them so a large chunk just ignores it.Seeing I am doing a good-job I will also be doing extra groups as of February and will be giving actual lectures besides my supervisor role.This is my first ""teaching"" job and I am wondering how I can advise the school to make changes in their curriculum without sounding like a know it all/arrogant.

Since we expect the number of students taking this course to grow in the future, we're looking at autograding to see if it's useful for us. In particular, we're looking at using Github Classroom. I have a number of related questions about this. Feel free to answer all or only some of them.Autograding leans heavily on unit tests to grade, and these unit tests are in the students' repositories. This means students can work on their code until it satisfies all the tests, which would result in a perfect grade. What kind of assignment setup/grading setups are possible that aren't so all or nothing?Can you stop students from altering files in the repository that they're not supposed to alter? For example, if their starter code contains a file assignment.py and tests.py, can you enforce that they only change the assignment file?Is it possible to apply hidden unit tests, that aren't visible in the students' starter code repository? For example, we might want them to implement a ML algorithm, then test it on a dataset they haven't seen yet, to see if it generalizes well. Also, it would enable us to have a tamper-proof unit test (see point 2).What are general issues to watch out for when using autograding for (some of) the assignments in a course? Or Github Classroom-specific problems?What are in general best practices for using autograding in a course?",2021-01-24 12:24:42,8696,True,199,5,0,2,"['python', 'auto-graders', 'machine-learning', 'github', 'unit-testing']",0,False

So local colleges/companies made an arrangement in which one company would set up a organization (where I am part of) that pools projects from several companies and redistributes them to the students who work in a location provided by the schools.Now the company that is doing the redistribution is actually getting paid for the assignments the students are doing and have strict deadlines. And we are nearing the final weeks of the first round of this system and he has become rather critical of the outcome of the projects.He thinks the projects could have been done better, comparing the results of the students (the youngest student is 17, and the eldest is 24 with the majority being between 18/20. Who just completed their first year (just below bachelor level) which was poked full with holes due to coronavirus) with professionally-made similar sites from major companies (that most likely had more time, resources and knowledge going in).I argued that when doing the projects we should keep the educational level of the student in mind, and can't expect high end stuff from them seeing they just got started (especially seeing that on paper they don't have any time to learn, but have to be ""productive""). I have tried teaching them, but there are several wildly different projects and in the limited time I got with them I am not able to go by every project to give a proper in-depth course on how to best do it.How could I convince my employer to ease up on the students, because in my opinion it was unwise to take on paid projects when you only got a bunch of first year college students to it in a rather limited time? And how could I advise him to simply say not take on so much work or such high demanding work when he knows that the skill level and time frame of the ""employees"" are so limited (because the next group is scheduled to start in February).Background:My employer has a small IT company, and the students are sort of his interns.

She wants to develop video games or animations, so she'll look at programs that other people have written, but these are generally big and hard to follow. What she can do on her own is find individual lines of code that she can understand, like a call to fill(color) and she'll change the color, or rect(x,y,width,height) and change the parameters to change where the rectangle is drawn.When I work with her, she'll ask for features, and I'll implement them and explain, and she seems to follow the explanation, but she can't generate the code herself, or understand how to decompose a complex task into pieces small enough that she can implement them, and then assemble the pieces into what she wants to buildI'm wondering if there's a curriculum or toolkit out there that would guide a child--slowly--through the skills. AFAICT, the Khan academy system isn't really that kind of thing, more like an environment and some tutorials, and access to other people's code, but not a linear course to follow.I'm thinking of something like Python Like You Mean It, but for kids, and ideally oriented towards graphical output--something that the child could follow along in a linear way, to provide structure to her studies.Or would that run the risk of killing a budding interest, and should I just let her play and wait and see where it goes?",2021-02-08 14:38:08,10097,True,143,6,1,4,"['student-motivation', 'programming', 'primary-school']",5,False

I planned to do this boardgame, where students experience the concept of reinforcement learning. They play a simplefied (3x3 field) version of chess only with pawns. The goal of each player is to either reach one pawn to the side of the opponent, by capturing all of the figures (of the opponent) or blocking the opponent (no moves possoble for the opponent). One player is the machine and one is the human. The machine player has an additional sheet with possible moves based on the game state, which he/she first randomly chooses from. In the beginning the machine is losing a lot, however over time, when it starts to win, it will keep this move. Over time, when the bad moves of the machine are getting eliminated, the machine gets better, and after a while impossible to beat.So now my question: Since teaching from home is still ongoing, is there any digital equivalent of this game or does anyone know anything similar, where students should experience machine learning in a simplified manner?Thank you",2021-02-11 11:24:27,2324,True,69,2,0,1,"['artificial-intelligence', 'machine-learning']",2,False

1188,6816,Textbook or video lectures to develope intuition for solving any unseen Graph Theory problems,"BackgroundHello, I am a third year undergraduate in CS. I am eager to pursue higher education from one of the best institutes in out country. For that I need to write a competitive exam, named GATE which had this syllabus for this year 2021. The syllabus remains more or less the same each and every year.The pattern is as follows, 65 questions , time 3 hours.
So for each question, I can afford at most 2.76 mins, which is quite a constrained amount of time, considering the level of the questions.This is to give an idea about the level of the questionsProblemAs per the given syllabus, the exam asks quite involving questions on Graph Theory, with questions based on properties of graph algorithms, tree formed by traversals, or coloring or other important but at times unseen (by the candidates) properties or concepts. Mostly they tend to ask questions from unseen topics, which probably one has not handled previously unless he is quite lucky. In such cases they definite the topics and then asks on them.Usually questions are like select the most appropriate options or marking the true statements.Now it is quite difficult (for me at least) to understand in 2.76 mins the new concept (defined in the question), read the statements, find counter examples for them to prove them wrong. At worse for some statements it might happen, that I am unable to find the counter example in that 2.76 mins of time, but it might happen that a more difficult counter example might exist.One can have a look at the type of question in graph theory here and here and here.Situation/RequestI have gone through CLRS and I am acquainted with the terminologies or graph theory algorithms and properties of tree produced by traversals etc. But the thing is that all these I have learnt, by going through the text many times and I have been quite slow at grasping those concepts given in CLRS.I have even gone to Kenneth Rosen's Discrete Mathematics texts.
As per the recommendations given in few coaching institutes (note that I do not go to any one of them, I do self study, got to know from my classmate), I have picked up Narsingh Deo's Graph Theory text and I am going through it now.[I have solved most of the exercise questions of CLRS (except for the $\star$ questions) mostly on my own but only for once, long a ago, while reading the text for the first time. Some questions even took a single day to think (too slow indeed). Rosen has a huge no of questions at the end of each text, that too I have solved not all but selectively as I found few problems repetitive there, and that too I have done only once. But I have read the text many more times (that too selectively), so that I do not forget the things which I have learnt...]Could anyone recommend me some good text or detailed video lecture series (not a very advanced one) that would help me to build intuition behind graph theory properties or statements unknown to me. The texts which I have already read are classic and fine, but I find it difficult at times to answer questions in the GATE, (might be due to the short time or might be that I am not that sharp) but still I want to sharpen my skills in dealing with these problems of graph theory.

Each dynamic call site has a corresponding expression tree, and a corresponding method.

Now, I understand that most of the UML diagram types would not be useful for a course in OO design patterns, but a few of them would be quite helpful.So my question, then, is how deeply into UML should I go?

Though the content is fine, and I end up asking questions on cs.StackExchange or StackOverflow. Then I thought of reading the reviews of the text and find out whether it is only me who is facing is the problem or there are people like me as well, finding the language hard to understand. Then I came across the review page of this book in good reads and among many reviews, I found one which explains the problem with the text probably. Here it is:Good content, horrendous writing.The good thing about this book is it is comprehensive and covers a lot of ground from different vantage points. For example, the parsing chapters also cover the design of lex and yacc apart from basic topics. The type checking and runtime environment chapters had examples from C and ML to cover different scenarios.Now the bad parts. The book is awfully written and I cannot understand how can a book in its 2nd (or 3rd?) edition continue to be so bad. It was shoddy writing throughout but the prize for the worst writing is these topics:Another consistent problem is their horrible use of passive voice. This interacts really badly with their discussion of mathematical aspects. While the use of passive voice might be excusable, its shoddy use is not.Reading this book often felt like deciphering some ancient text. I needed to translate a lot of obtuse writing into something that can be understood in my head. This translation happens for all readings involuntarily but it was alarming I had to consciously do it for this book.I am not sure why is this book called a ""classic"" computer science book. It is more like a kind of book that students are forced to study by their professors. This book is impossible to read unless you are following some other source. I followed Prof. Alex Aiken's lecturesThis book might be responsible for the unpopularity of the study and research in programming languages. I agree compilers are not easy but this book has taken a difficult topic and made it incomprehensible thereby doing a disservice to this whole field of study.I am not criticizing the text or authors. The only thing is that probably the text does not suit a self-learner like myself. Could anyone suggest a compiler text to substitute the red dragon book possibly? A book with easy language, such that one easily understand what the authors tried to mean just by reading a sentence once.

I couldn't find anything about it, so I thought about a way to do it:One of the problem is that the time complexity is quite ugly to compute. I found the relation:
$$C(n, T) = \sum\limits_{t=0}^T\left(C\left(\frac{n}{2}, t\right) + C\left(\frac{n}{2}, T-t\right)\right) + \Theta(1)$$

These virtual address bits used for indexing into the cache can cause two different virtual addresses which map to the same physical memory frame to map to different cache blocks.But what I do not understand is how the concept of page coloring [using as many bits as we calculated above] the main memory frames removes this problem of aliasing? Please can anyone suggest to me some resource (preferably a video resource) that explains this concept in detail possibly taking examples?Thank you.",2021-07-12 06:11:37,9124,False,34,1,0,0,"['self-learning', 'resource-request', 'architecture', 'operating-systems']",1,False

My students are well aware of this, and signed up for the course fully knowing that I would be exploring alongside them.  They are pretty enthusiastic to learn together, particularly since software engineering is an extremely rare topic for high schools.  They have all completed AP Computer Science A, meaning that they are familiar with object basics, polymorphism, etc.I heard from a friend whose graduate degree is in SE that her professor had assigned student presentations about design patterns, and it seems like a good idea to me. I would like to assign groups to each learn about, and present, one pattern to the class.  My current thought is to ask the students to structure their lessons thusly:I will model what I expect with two object patterns myself first (I was thinking about presenting singleton and observer patterns, though I am open to other suggestions if there are better choices), then allow them time to work in their own patterns.I figure that each group will have roughly 40 minutes to present, and 10 minutes out of a 50 minute period the next day for their reinforcement quiz.Here are my questions:Does this seem reasonable given the topic?  Are there elements that I am missing that are specific to design patterns?  Should I allow students to freely pick from the design patterns, or should I restrict them to easier ones?

1317,7151,Is there a computer science certification program outside of academic programs?,"Nowadays, the standard way to learn computer science is at a university, though a formal computer science degree program or at least coursework. What I've been wondering is if there is a certification program or exam that exists outside of academia, or at least outside of traditional degree programs, that certifies that someone has mastered the basics of computer science (i.e. looping and branching, pointers, data types, recursion, stacks, queues, automata, Turing machines, Lambda calculus, etc.). Does such a program or exam exist?To be clear, I have found many exams and certification programs that cover various programming languages and professional areas of computer work (e.g. repair, administration, management, etc.), but that's not really what I'm looking for. Someone certified in J2EE enterprise development or in Oracle 11g administration may be competent to hold an industry job but does not necessarily have a foundation in the theories of computer science (may not know the difference between a context-free grammar and a context-sensitive one, may not be aware of the proof of the Halting Problem, etc.). What I'm looking for would match at least most of the following criteria:I am aware that essentially all of computer science can be studied independently without the assistance of a university, but that path does not normally lead to any sort of formal educational credential of achievement. I'm looking for something along the lines of, ""Yes, my degree was in history with a minor in sociology, but I passed the International Competency Examination in Computer Science Theory with a score of A, so I'm at the same level as a typical computer science graduate.""I am also aware of so-called ""coding boot camps"" that largely exist outside of academia, but those are still sort of an opposite to my question.

1318,7154,What controversies in computer science education exist today?,"I remember 20 years ago (when I was doing my degree in computer science) that there were a lot of instructors who thought that the impending (""real soon now"") transition from using C++ as the programming language of instruction to Java represented a loosening of standards — i.e. that Java was ""too easy"" and allowed students to get away with not fully mastering concepts that Java handled on its own (e.g. manually freeing memory vs relying on the garbage collector). There were some good points to this argument but it also became clear that higher-level languages like Java and C# allow students to spend more time on advanced concepts (e.g. large and complex data structures) rather than chasing down another stray pointer or memory leak. After I had my degree in hand and started writing real software, I realized that I had spent so much time chasing segmentation faults and off-by-one errors in C++ that I really did have a shaky foundation on more abstract concepts. Seeing OOP implemented right in C# was mind-blowing for me — now it finally made sense why programming to an interface was how polymorphism worked.Are there any similar controversies today in terms of what a computer science education should consist of or how it should be delivered?",2021-12-15 18:55:20,1931,True,"7,965",32,7,6,"['curriculum-design', 'undergraduate']",10,False

1325,7205,How to respond to the two-handed approach to swapping,"I was introducing lists to someone young (in Scratch). Creating a list is boring, so I opted to introduce something that you can do with lists, but requires some thinking: swapping. I introduced it by putting out four pencils in a row, like this. I asked them to swap the second and fourth items in the array (in reality).They took both their hands, picked up the second and fourth pencils (each in one hand), and swapped them! That works in reality... but isn't right in computer science. So, I told them, try doing it with only one hand. Predictably, they couldn't. I introduced a temporary spot, where they could put one pencil. I was hoping they would do something like this:They figured it out. But they asked me something like this: ""Why can't I use two hands?"". I wasn't sure how to answer that. The obvious answer is... the computer only has one hand (this was Scratch, so multithreading didn't exist). But... I'm hesitant to say that for two reasons: (1) in Python, the ""two-hands"" approach works (a, b = b, a, see this Stack Overflow question) and (2) multithreading exists, and there are some (obscure) ways to swap two variables without a temporary variable.

1329,7234,Grading programming exercises: the quality vs. originality paradox,"BACKGROUND: I teach a C++ course with 300 students where the grade is based on programming assignments. We use automatic tools to assess the assignment correctness (using many unit-tests), code quality (using clang-tidy), and to check plagiarism. In addition, the students present some of their solutions to the lecturer or TA in an online interview, and are graded by six quality criteria: organization, testing, correctness, efficiency, readability, and safety (I used recommendations from here for the rubric).Last year, while I was interviewing students, I noticed a paradoxical phoenomenon: about half the students wrote perfect code (100% in all rubrics), and they all used very similar ideas - similar tricks, algorithms, etc. While the solutions were not entirely identical (so I cannot blame them for plagiarism), I was quite convinced that some of them shared their ideas with others. On the other hand, about half the students wrote mediocre code (60-70% in most rubrics), and their work was very different than others - I was quite convinced that they did all the work by themselves.It turned out that I gave a lower grade to students who did all work by themselves, than to students who (probably) consulted other students and used their ideas. My grading scheme does not properly encourage students to do original work. Note that the course guidelines do not forbid students to consult each other.
